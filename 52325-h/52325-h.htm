<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">Preface</span></h2>
<p>From 1946 until about 1956 I carried out fieldwork intermittently
on the geology and artesian water supply of the
Grand Junction area, Colorado, the results of which have been
published.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> The area mapped geologically contains about 332
square miles in the west-central part of Mesa County and includes
all of Colorado National Monument. During the fieldwork
several successive custodians or superintendents and
several park naturalists urged that upon completion of my professional
paper I prepare a brief account of the geology of the
Monument in terms understandable by laymen, and which
could be sold at the Visitor Center. This I was happy to do and
there resulted &ldquo;The geologic story of Colorado National Monument,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
published by the Colorado and Black Canyon Natural
History Association in cooperation with the National Park
Service. This report contained colored sketches by John R.
Stacy and a colored cover, but the photographs and many of
the drawings were reproduced in black and white.</p>
<p>Later, after I had prepared popular style reports containing
mostly color photographs on Canyonlands<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
and Arches<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> National
Parks, officials of Colorado National Monument and I
discussed the possibility of preparing a revised and enlarged
edition of my 1965 report containing mainly color photographs,
inasmuch as the supply of the black and white edition
was nearing exhaustion, and later became out of print. At the
meeting in the Monument on June 8, 1976, attended by Robert
(Bob) E. Benton, Superintendent, A. J. (Jerry) Banta, Supervising
Park Ranger, Margaret Short, Park Naturalist and
Secretary of the Natural History Association, and me, it was
agreed that: (1) A revised and enlarged edition containing
mostly color photographs should be prepared for publication
as a bulletin of the U.S. Geological Survey, and (2) that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_XII">XII</span>
Colorado and Black Canyon Natural History Association gave
its permission for use of any or all of the copyrighted material
in the first edition. The present report resulted.</p>
<p>The cover is a duotone of a 9- &times; 12-cm infrared photograph
of Independence Monument taken by me. (See also <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>.)
Most of the color photographs were taken by me on 4- &times; 5-inch
or 9- &times; 12-cm tripod mounted cameras using lenses of several
focal lengths, but I took some with 35-mm cameras. Some of
the color photographs and all the black and white ones were
taken by those credited in the captions, to whom grateful acknowledgment
is made. The points from which most of the
photographs were taken are shown in <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a>.</p>

<p>The story of how
Colorado National Monument
came into being is as colorful as
the canyons and cliffs themselves.
The fantastic canyon country had a
magical attraction for John Otto<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>)
who, in 1906, camped near the northeastern mouth of
Monument Canyon and began building trails into the canyons
and onto the mesas&mdash;the high tablelands that separate the
deep canyons. He did this back-breaking work simply because
he wanted to and so that others could share the beauty of this
wild country.</p>
<p>In 1907 Otto got the Grand Junction Chamber of Commerce
to petition Secretary of the Interior James A. Garfield to set
aside the area as a National Monument. Otto&rsquo;s dream came
true on May 24, 1911, when President William Howard Taft
signed the proclamation creating the Monument. On June 14,
Otto climbed to the top of Independence Monument (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>)
where he placed the Stars and Stripes to celebrate Flag Day.
For several years thereafter Otto placed the flag atop Independence
Monument on July 4th to celebrate Independence
Day.</p>
<p>Until about 1921 the only routes into the Monument proper
were John Otto&rsquo;s trails, but in that year the ranchers of Glade
Park joined with Otto in building the steep, twisting Serpents
Trail from No Thoroughfare Canyon to the mesa above&mdash;a
much shorter route to Grand Junction. It had 54 switchbacks
and climbed about 1,500 feet in 2&frac12; miles. The Serpents Trail
was included in the Monument in 1933 and was used until 1950
when an easier route was built up the west side of No
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
Thoroughfare Canyon and through a tunnel to the top of the
mesa (figs. <a href="#fig3">3</a>, <a href="#fig56">56</a>). The Serpents Trail has been preserved as an
interesting foot trail (<a href="#fig55">fig. 55</a>), which can be hiked downhill in an
hour or so. A parking area near the foot of the trail allows one
member of a group to drive ahead to await the others.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1924 John Otto got the idea that the Monument should
include a herd of big game, so he talked the Colorado Game
and Fish Department into shipping six young elk, and he got
the local Elks Lodge to pay the transportation costs. The elk
were turned loose in Monument Canyon, but they found the
sparse vegetation and scant water supply ill suited to their
needs, so after a few years they found a way out over the rim
and migrated about 20 miles south of the Monument to lush
high country where they joined with native elk and multiplied
to become the ancestors of the present fine herd on Pi&ntilde;on Mesa
(shown in <a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a><i>D</i>). Occasionally a few return to the Monument
and may be seen mainly in Ute Canyon. Native mule deer
are frequently seen in and near the Monument.</p>
<p>Far from being discouraged, Otto then hatched the idea to
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
start a buffalo<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> herd to be purchased by donations of buffalo
nickels from school children and by contributions from the
Odd Fellows and others. He finally raised enough money to get
the patient Game and Fish Department to send him two cows
and one bull. Unfortunately the bull died, so Otto talked the
National Park Service into shipping him a bull from Yellowstone
National Park. This time success crowned his efforts,
and the small herd eventually multiplied to as many as 45 animals,
but generally the herd has been kept at about 20-25 head
ever since. You may spot some of them when you gaze down
into Monument or Ute Canyons or when you drive past the
northeastern boundary. Rarely, you may spot one in Red
Canyon.</p>
<p>At the northeast corner of Fourth Street and Ute Avenue in
Grand Junction is a most unusual object, which illustrates yet
another peculiarity of John Otto&mdash;fantastic father of Colorado
National Monument (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). Its history is best told by quoting
from Al Look,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> though its purpose still remains a mystery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day a horse drawn dray backed up to a vacant lot on Grand Junction&rsquo;s
Main Street [corner 6th] and unloaded a granite cube four feet square, carved
on two sides. It weighed more than a ton and Otto supervised the setting.</p>
<p>One side [now
facing west and not visible in <a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>] showed a three foot circle
containing a swastika with a five pointed star in each quarter. Above the
emblem was carved &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; and below read &ldquo;Cross of Ages.&rdquo; The
second side [now
facing south, and shown in <a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>] was beyond normal comprehension.
Two large W&rsquo;s on either side of a small swastika were over the letters
or initials P.P., then four chain links with the letters T, H, L, J. inscribed,
followed by the initials I.E. Below on the left was &ldquo;1918,&rdquo; over &ldquo;Year 1&rdquo;. On
the right was &ldquo;Old Count&rdquo; and under it &ldquo;New Count.&rdquo; Between them stands
the word &lsquo;MARCH.&rsquo; Below this are abbreviations for the seven days of the
week with the figure 1 under MON ending with a 6 under SAT. The bottom
line [most of which is barely visible in the photograph] contained the figure 7
in a circle, a carpenter&rsquo;s square, a small rectangle, probably representing a
level, a plumb bob, a carpenter&rsquo;s compass and a circle showing the western
hemisphere. That is all. It made sense to John Otto because from somewhere
he gathered considerable money to have this monument carved by the local
gravestone merchant. It stood for several years to mystify pedestrians, and
was finally moved beside the Redlands road to the [east entrance of] Colorado
Monument where it is now hidden by weeds.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was still there in the 50&rsquo;s when my family and I were
startled to find it. We were afraid it might be lost forever so
are glad it finally found a safe resting place on a concrete slab
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
at the museum. I shall greatly appreciate hearing from any
reader who can decipher this enigma.</p>

</div>
<p>Otto&rsquo;s rock is at the southwest corner of The Historical
Museum and Institute of Western Colorado. The main attraction
inside is a life-size skeleton of <i>Allosaurus</i> (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>), whose
bones are exact plastic replicas of real ones at the museum of
Brigham Young University, at Provo, Utah. The painstaking
casting of the &ldquo;bones&rdquo; and assembly of the self-supporting
skeleton was done by Al T. Look, son of author Al Look listed
under &ldquo;References.&rdquo; The museum also houses other items of
interest from the Grand Junction area.</p>
<p>Construction of the scenic Rim Rock Drive through the
Monument was begun by the National Park Service about
1931 using workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps, and
the drive eventually was completed to join roads from Fruita
and Grand Junction. The route from Fruita includes a winding
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
road up Fruita Canyon and through two tunnels to the mesa
(figs. <a href="#fig3">3</a>, <a href="#fig44">44</a>, <a href="#fig45">45</a>).</p>
<p>A modern Visitor Center, new housing facilities for park personnel,
additions to the campgrounds, the Devils Kitchen Picnic
Area near the East Entrance, several self-guiding nature
trails, and additional overlooks and roadside exhibits were
completed in 1964 as part of the Mission 66 program of the National
Park Service.</p>
<p>The Monument originally included 13,749 acres, but boundary
changes in 1933 and 1939 increased the total to 17,660
acres, and the inclusion of all of No Thoroughfare Canyon and
other boundary adjustments in 1978 increased the size to
about 20,457 acres, or about 32 square miles (see map, <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>John Otto, early explorers, and even the Ute Indians who

<p>Many years ago Al Look, of Grand Junction, discovered and
excavated two caves in the part of No Thoroughfare Canyon
formerly outside the Monument. He found stone projectile
points, knives, awls, milling stones, parts of a sandal and
coiled basket, reed matting, corn, corncobs, acorns, and animal
bones, but no pottery&mdash;indicating that the people had not progressed
beyond basket making. Similar artifacts were found in
several other nearby places on the Uncompahgre Plateau. Archaeologists
have named this old culture the Uncompahgre
Complex, and date it back to a few thousand years before the
time of Christ.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> It should be pointed out that it is unlawful to
remove artifacts, fossils, rocks, or minerals from a National
Park or Monument.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1963 an archaeological survey of Colorado
National Monument was carried out, under the terms of an
agreement between the National Park Service and the University
of Colorado, by Stroh and Ewing and their field assistants.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
A total of 75 aboriginal sites were found of which 71
were within the Monument boundaries of that date, and 4 were
closely adjacent. These comprised 41 open campsites, 24 rock
shelters, 2 small caves, and 8 chipping stations. Artifacts recovered
included 62 projectile points, 21 metates (grinding
stones), 40 manos (hand stones), 111 whole or fragments of
blades or scrapers, 6 choppers, several fragments of baskets,
potsherds (bits of broken pottery) at two sites, 2 wood awls,
several strands of yucca fibers, 3 corncobs, 6 kernels of corn,
several bone fragments, storage cists at five sites, and petroglyphs
at three locations.</p>
<p>Stroh and Ewing concluded that the majority of the sites appear
to have been the campsites of a hunting and gathering
people, and they speculated that there may have been
aboriginal activity in the area from as long as several thousand
years ago to relatively recent times.</p>
<p>The largest of the petroglyphs,<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> or rock drawings, are on a
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
fallen slab of Wingate Sandstone in No Thoroughfare Canyon,
and are shown in <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>. Archaeologist John Crouch (<a href="#fn_10">footnote 10</a>),
who kindly reexamined these petroglyphs in February
1980, told me that most of the figures appear to be Shoshonian
(Ute), but that some may be of the Fremont culture<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> or even
older.</p>

<p>Prior to 1881 the Monument area was inhabited only by
Ute Indians, but it was visited from time to time by a few fur
trappers, explorers, and geologists. In 1776 an expedition led
by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante passed northward
across Grand Mesa, the high plateau just east of the area,
which is pointed out in many of the photographs. A trading
post was built by Joseph Roubidoux about 1838 just above the
present site of Grand Junction. In 1853 Captain John W. Gunnison,
seeking a new route for a transcontinental railroad, led
an exploring party down what is now the Gunnison River
Valley, past the confluence with the Grand River (now called
the Colorado, <a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>), and on down the valley. Geologists and
topographers of the Hayden Survey found only Ute Indians in
the area in 1875 and 1876, and their field season of 1875 was
abruptly cut short because of skirmishes with hostile Utes.
After the Meeker (Colorado) Massacre of 1879, believed by
many to have been caused mainly by the ignorance and shortsightedness
of Meeker himself, treaties were signed forcing the
Utes out of western Colorado onto reservations in eastern
Utah, and the last of the Utes was reportedly out of the area by
September 1881. The Grand Valley was immediately opened to
settlement, and the first ranch was staked out on September 7,
1881. Nineteen days later George A. Crawford founded Grand
Junction as a townsite and formed the Grand Junction Town
Company the next month. The success of the new town was
assured on November 21, 1882, when the narrow-gage line of
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (now Denver and Rio

<p>Of the many early expeditions down the Colorado
River, only one went past what is now Colorado National
Monument&mdash;the ill-fated Brown-Stanton expedition. After the
pioneering expeditions of 1869 and 1871 down the Green and
Colorado Rivers by Major John Wesley Powell and his men,
the many ensuing river expeditions started in Utah or Wyoming;
but the first phase of the Brown-Stanton expedition
started in Colorado&mdash;at Grand Junction. In 1889 Frank M.
Brown organized a company for the construction of the proposed
Denver, Colorado Canyon, and Pacific Railway, which
was to carry coal from mines in Colorado over a &ldquo;water-level&rdquo;
line through the mighty canyons of the Colorado River to the
Gulf of California some 1,200 miles away, from which coal
would be shipped to various ports in California. On March 26,
1889, president Brown, chief engineer F. C. Kendricks, and
assistant engineer T. P. Rigney drove the first stake at Grand
Junction for a survey of the new line. Then Brown left for the
East to obtain financing, and the other two men plus some
hired hands took off in a boat down the Grand River. After
reaching the confluence, they towed the boat up the Green
River to the town of Green River, Utah, thus becoming the
first to make this trip upstream, albeit on foot and dragging
their boats. Brown, who had returned from the East, his newly
appointed chief engineer Robert Brewster Stanton, and 14
others in six ill-designed boats of cedar rather than oak, left
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
Green River, Utah, on May 25, 1889. Against the advice of Major
Powell and others, they carried no life preservers. After
many mishaps, Brown and two others were drowned near the
head of Marble Canyon, and the ill-fated expedition temporarily
ground to a halt. However, the indefatigable Stanton had
new boats built of oak, and with a reorganized party of 12 left
the mouth of the Dirty Devil River on November 25. After
many additional mishaps the party finally reached the Gulf of
California on April 26, 1890. In spite of Stanton&rsquo;s heroic efforts,
the railroad was never built, and the Grand Canyon was
spared the huffing and puffing of locomotives.</p>

<p>As shown in figures <a href="#fig3">3</a>, <a href="#fig8">8</a>, and <a href="#fig26">26</a>, the first major canyon
west of the West Entrance of the monument is called Kodels
Canyon (pronounced \&lsquo;k&#333;d<sup>&#477;</sup>ls\). It was named after an early-day
stonemason turned prospector, a hermit, who came to the
Fruita area before 1900 and prospected for gold until at least
1930 in the canyon that now bears his name. He seemingly
built a cabin or house near the mouth of the canyon, spent
most of the rest of his life in a vain quest for gold in the canyon,
barricaded his house against would-be intruders, and took
potshots at anyone approaching his home for fear they were
after his &ldquo;gold.&rdquo; Some thought him only half crazy, but when
he took repeated shots at an Indian named Henry Kadig, he
was adjudged wholly insane and sent to the mental hospital at
Pueblo, Colorado, for several years. When he got out he sold the
grazing rights in his canyon to the late Irving Beard of Fruita,
and seemingly was not heard from again. According to various
estimates, Kodel dug an adit between 18 and 150 feet into the
dark Proterozoic rock in the side of the canyon (shown in <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>),
then sunk a shaft somewhere between 30 and 50 feet deep.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
He was always &ldquo;on the verge of a big strike,&rdquo; but there is no
record of any actual production.</p>
<p>Later, a prospector from the midwest spent several summers
digging in Devils Canyon, the next major canyon to the west,
but he was equally unsuccessful. The unsuccessful attempts of
Kodel and others is not surprising, for the two canyons are
some 100 miles north of the Colorado mineral belt&mdash;a band extending
roughly from Boulder to the western part of the San
Juan Mountains, in which ore-bearing Upper Cretaceous or
lower Tertiary rocks were intruded into all overlying rocks of
whatever age.</p>

</div>
<p>About 3 miles west of
the Glade Park Store and
Post Office are three large
caves in a cliff of the Wingate
Sandstone on the north wall of a
canyon containing a tributary of Clark&rsquo;s Wash.
The middle cave, which formerly contained a small one-room
framehouse and other improvements, was occupied for about
40 years prior to 1958 by Mrs. Laura Hazel Miller (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). A
large cave just to the west (left) was used for storage, and
another large cave just to the east formerly was fenced to
shelter domestic animals. Mrs. Miller lived alone most of this
time but had a dog for companionship the last few years she
lived in the cave. When my wife and I visited her in the mid-fifties
we had a very pleasant conversation with this very intelligent
woman and could hardly believe she was 87 years old.
She could not understand why anyone could live in crowded
cities as she much preferred the peace and quiet of her cave.
Once a week she walked the 6 miles round trip to and from the
Glade Park Store and Post Office, bought what few necessities
she needed, and telephoned her daughter in Grand Junction.
Maybe she had something the rest of us have missed! She
became sick in her nineties and moved to Grand Junction to
live with her daughter. After she died, the property was
sold, and I have since observed that vandals had burned
her one room house and had destroyed most of the other
improvements.</p>

<h2 class="pcap" id="c10">Artesian Wells</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p013a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="270" />
</div>
<p>It may surprise you to
learn that several sandstone formations
supply water to artesian
wells northeast of the Monument
in The Redlands, Orchard Mesa, and
the southwestern side of the Grand
Valley, most of which are 500 to
more than 1,000 feet deep. When first
drilled and for some years later these wells flowed at the land
surface, but eventually after too many wells had been drilled
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
too close together, each well reduced the output of neighboring
wells until most wells ceased to flow naturally. This made it
necessary for most well owners to install pumps, which further
aggravated the problem by reducing the artesian head (the
height to which the water rises above the formation from
which it issues). This created a situation not unlike too many
children sucking on straws in the same ice cream soda, and led
to a detailed investigation by the U.S. Geological Survey and
the Colorado Water Conservation Board,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> outgrowths of
which were the present report and its predecessors.</p>
<p>The water system of the Ute Conservancy District was virtually
completed by late 1964 and began to supply water to
rural residents of Grand Valley between the towns of Palisade
and Mack through a vast network of pipelines. The water is obtained
from surface sources on the north flank of Grand Mesa
east of the valley and is brought to the valley via a pipeline
down the valley of Plateau Creek. Use of the new water has
reduced the draft on many of the artesian wells. The reduced
draft has locally arrested the decline in the artesian head or
has actually allowed some recovery in head.</p>
<p>In order of their importance and productivity the water-bearing
sandstones are the Entrada, the Wingate, and local
sandstone lenses in the lower part (Salt Wash Member) of the
Morrison Formation (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). In a few places small flows or
yields are obtained from wells that tap the Dakota Sandstone
and underlying Burro Canyon Formation, but inasmuch as the
Dakota contains some marine sandstones from which all the
salt seemingly has not yet been flushed out, the water from
most of these wells is brackish or salty.</p>
<p>As we will see on the trip &ldquo;From Grand Junction through
The Redlands to the West Entrance of the Monument,&rdquo; pages
<a href="#Page_88">88</a>-95, in and near the Monument these sandstones look bone
dry, so how can they supply water to artesian wells? They are
indeed dry in all the cliff exposures, but as will be noted later
when the bending and breaking of the rocks are discussed
(p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>-71), erosion has exposed the upturned sandstones so
that they may take in water from the many small streams that
drain the Monument and adjacent areas for short periods after
summer thundershowers or during spring thaws. The water
moves slowly down the dipping sandstones and becomes
trapped under pressure beneath overlying beds of siltstone or
mudstone&mdash;materials that are nearly impervious.</p>

<h2 class="pcap" id="c11">Geographic Setting</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p014.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="343" />
</div>
<p>Geologists and geographers have divided the
United States into many provinces, each of which has distinctive
geologic and topographic characteristics that set it apart
from the others. Colorado National Monument is in the northeastern
part of the Canyon Lands section of the Colorado
Plateau Province&mdash;a province that contains 15 national parks
and monuments, about 3 times as many as any other province.
This province, hereinafter referred to simply as the Colorado
Plateau, or the Plateau, covers some 150,000 square miles and
extends from Rifle, Colo., at the northeast to a little beyond
Flagstaff, Ariz., at the southwest, and from Cedar City, Utah,
at the west nearly to Albuquerque, N. Mex., at the southeast.
This scenic province consists of high plateaus generally ranging
in altitude from 4,500 feet to more than 7,000 feet, which
are deeply and intricately dissected by literally thousands of
canyons.</p>
<p>Colorado National Monument is drained entirely by the
Colorado River, which flows to the northwest in the wide
Grand Valley just a few miles from the northeastern border
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). The small streams that drain the Monument contain
water only after summer thundershowers or after rapid
snowmelt.</p>
<p>Why is the large valley of the Colorado River called the
Grand Valley? The Colorado River northeast from its confluence
with the Green River in the middle of Canyonlands
National Park<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> formerly was called the Grand River, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Green and Grand joined at the confluence to form the Colorado
River. The Grand River was renamed Colorado River by act of
the Colorado State Legislature approved March 24, 1921, and
approved by act of Congress July 25, 1921. But the old term
still remains in names such as Grand County, Colo., the headwaters
region; Grand Valley, a town 16 miles west of Rifle,
Colo.; Grand Valley between Palisade and Mack, Colo.; Grand
Mesa, an extensive plateau which towers more than a mile
above the Grand and Gunnison River Valleys; Grand Junction,
Colo., a city appropriately situated at the confluence of the
Grand and Gunnison Rivers; and Grand County, Utah, which
the river traverses after entering Utah.</p>
<h2 class="pcap" id="c12">The Geologic Story Begins</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p014a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="389" />
</div>
<p>Colorado National Monument is a land of brightly
colored cliff-walled canyons and towering monoliths&mdash;a majestic
sample of mysterious canyonlands that stretch hundreds
of miles to the west and south. Now a desert region more than
a mile above the sea, it was not always so. More than a billion
years ago the site of the Monument was deep beneath the sea.
Later, lofty mountains were pushed up only to be obliterated
eventually by the slow but relentless forces of erosion. Millions
of years later the earth shook to the stride of 10-ton
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
dinosaurs&mdash;then the sea returned again and sharks swam over
the region looking for food.</p>
<p>These are but a few samples of the interesting&mdash;even exciting&mdash;events
in the long geologic history of the Monument.
Many pages, indeed several whole chapters, of its history are
missing and must be inferred from nearby regions where the
story is more complete. Thus, the cliffs and canyons you are
looking at did not get that way overnight. An understanding
of the geologic processes and events that led to the scenic
features of today should help you toward a clearer picture and
greater appreciation of nature&rsquo;s handiworks (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>).</p>
<p>Geologists recognize rocks of three distinctly different
modes of origin&mdash;sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic, and
there are many variations of each type. The sedimentary rocks
of the Monument are composed of clay, silt, sand, and gravel
carried and deposited by moving water; silt and fine sand
transported by wind; and some limestone, composed mainly of
the mineral calcium carbonate, which was precipitated from
water solutions in freshwater lakes. In areas not far to the
northeast and southwest are many sedimentary rocks of
marine origin, that is, materials that were deposited in the
ocean or shallow inland seas, but in the Monument marine
sedimentary rocks occur only in parts of the Dakota Sandstone;
however, the overlying marine Mancos Shale underlies
the adjacent Grand Valley and forms the lower slopes of the
Book Cliffs across the valley (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>).</p>
<p>Igneous rocks were solidified from liquid molten rock intruded
upward into any preexisting rocks along cracks, joints,
and faults. Molten rock that reaches the land surface and
forms volcanos or lava flows is called extrusive igneous rock.
Joints are cracks or breaks in rocks along which no movement
has taken place. Faults are cracks or joints along which one
side has moved relative to the other. Different types of faults
are shown in <a href="#fig28">figure 28</a>. Metamorphic rocks were formed from
either of the other types by great heat and pressure at extreme
depths in the Earth&rsquo;s crust. Metamorphic rocks and some intrusive
igneous rocks make up the hard, dark rock that floors
all the deep canyons in and near the Monument. The nearest
extrusive igneous rocks are the thick, dark lava flows that cap
towering Grand Mesa to the east and Battlement Mesa to the
northeast.</p>

<p>After the materials of the sedimentary rocks were deposited
and covered by younger layers, they generally became
saturated or partly saturated with ground water containing
small amounts of dissolved minerals. Some of these minerals
precipitated from solution and cemented the loose particles
into rocks of varying hardness. Thus, most of the sandstones
are partly cemented with the mineral calcite, composed of
calcium carbonate (CaCO&#8323;), but some are cemented also with
silica (SiO&#8322;) or hematite (Fe&#8322;O&#8323;).</p>
<p>Look almost anywhere in the Monument and you will see
that the rocks are piled up in layers of different color, thickness,
and hardness&mdash;much like a vast layer cake. In most of the
Monument, these layers are flat or slope gently down to the
northeast, but along the northeastern boundary they are
sharply bent or broken as though the cake had been carelessly
placed over the edge of a table and had sagged.</p>
<p>Let us consider these layers one by one, beginning with the
oldest at the bottom, for each is a partial record of events long
past. Layers of rock that can be easily recognized and distinguished
from other layers are called formations and are
named after a place where they are well exposed. For the name
to be accepted for general usage it must be the first published
description in a technical report of a particular sequence of
rock layers. The places after which the formations of the
Monument were named are given in the rock column (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>),
and the outcrops of the formations are shown on the geologic
map (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). In the pages that follow, the geologic events that
shaped the Monument we see today are discussed in
chronological order, beginning with the oldest rocks that floor
the deep canyons.</p>

<p>The dark rocks that floor all the large canyons of the
Monument (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) and form the high bluffs along the northeastern
boundary (figs. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <a href="#fig38">38</a>, <a href="#fig40">40</a>, <a href="#fig41">41</a>) are of early Proterozoic<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
age&mdash;among the oldest known rocks of the Earth. Most were
once sand and mud that spread out on the bottom of the sea
and later hardened into sedimentary rocks (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>-1). After
thousands of feet of such rocks had accumulated, they were
squeezed, bent, and lifted up by slow but mighty movements
of the Earth&rsquo;s crust to form high mountains perhaps like the
Rockies. Heat and pressure that developed at great depth in
the roots of these mountains changed the sediments into metamorphic
rocks known as schist (finely banded) and gneiss
(coarsely banded) (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>-2). The rocks are about 1&frac12; billion
years old (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).</p>
<p>Later in Proterozoic time, about a billion years ago, molten
material from below was forced upward along cracks or faults
and cooled slowly to form thin seams or dikes and irregular
bodies of granite (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>-3). Dikes are called pegmatite when
they contain large crystals of pink feldspar, white or clear
quartz, black tourmaline, and large flakes of white mica. Small
pegmatite dikes that pass through the older schist and gneiss
may be seen along roadcuts in Fruita and No Thoroughfare
Canyons.</p>

</div>
<p>If you look down into any of the large canyons in the
Monument, you will notice a brick-red formation, the Chinle,
which forms steep slopes at the foot of the high cliffs and lies
upon the dark Proterozoic rocks along nearly straight lines of
contact. Such a straight-line contact is particularly well shown
about midway up the high bluffs along the northeastern
boundary of the Monument (<a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>). If the red layer and all
overlying rocks were stripped away, these straight lines would
be the exposed edges of a remarkably smooth, nearly flat erosion
surface on the top of the dark Proterozoic rocks, as shown
in the last diagram of <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>. A vast amount of time passed
between the carving of this surface and the deposition of the
red Chinle, and no record of the events during this time is preserved
in the Monument.</p>
<p>During the latter part of the Proterozoic Eon and parts of
the long Paleozoic Era that followed, the dark rocks were
submerged beneath the sea several times and received
sediments now found in areas to the northeast and southwest.
Beginning in the Pennsylvanian Period some 330 million years
ago (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>), a large upfold of the rocks, or anticline (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>),
known to geologists as the Uncompahgre Highland, rose high
above sea level, probably reaching its highest level in Late
Pennsylvanian or Permian time. This old highland formed an
imposing chain of mountains in about the position of the present
Uncompahgre Plateau.</p>
<p>After the old rocks were pushed up into these high mountains
what became of them? From the moment the mountains
began to rise, their rocks were buffeted by wind, pounded by
rain, pried open by frost, scoured by debris-laden streams and,
perhaps by glaciers, and the loosened rock particles were
dissolved or carried to the sea. Most rocks are brittle enough to
crack when bent by Earth forces. Such cracks, called joints,
are easy targets for erosion. The freezing of water in joints
tends to pry the rocks apart. The breakup of the rocks was
hastened by the chemical attack on rock minerals by water
charged with oxygen and carbon dioxide. When land plants
became established in later geologic eras, soil acids formed
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
from decaying vegetation also assisted materially in breaking
up the rocks.</p>
<p>These same erosion processes are going on today, but their
effects are scarcely noticeable from year to year except in soft
earth after storms or floods. During eons of time, however, the
mountains were again worn down to a nearly level plain. Missing
between the red Chinle and the dark rocks are many
thousands of feet of rocks, some of which once covered this surface
and still occur in other regions less affected by erosion.
This gap in the rock record, which represents more than a
billion years, is known to geologists as a great unconformity.
Missing are part of the lower Proterozoic rocks, all the upper
Proterozoic rocks, all those of the Paleozoic Era, and part of
those of the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era. (See figs. <a href="#fig7">7</a>
and <a href="#fig61">61</a>.)</p>
<p>Traces of primitive life have been found in some Proterozoic
rocks in the form of lime-secreting algae and casts of worms,
but no fossils of more advanced types have been found because
at that time the primitive animals seemingly had not yet
developed shells or skeletons. The ensuing Paleozoic Era saw
the appearance and great development of shellfish, fish, amphibians,
reptiles, and primitive plants. Some of the rock
layers of ages missing at the Monument may be seen as near as
Glenwood Springs to the northeast and Gateway to the
southwest.</p>

<img src="images/p019a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="173" />
</div>
<p>All the layers of sedimentary rocks preserved in the
Monument above the dark Proterozoic ones were deposited by
wind and water during the Mesozoic Era. This long era has
been called the age of reptiles, for reptiles, including dinosaurs
(meaning terrible lizards), were then the dominant land
animals. The Mesozoic Era has been divided into three
parts&mdash;the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods. Rocks
of each of these periods crop out in the Monument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c16">Early Landscape</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p020.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="151" />
</div>
<p>By late Triassic time
the Monument was part of a
nearly flat plain cut on the dark Proterozoic rocks, but there
were hills or low mountains to the northeast. Streams from
these hills dropped mud, silt, sand, and some gravel on this
plain and into many small lakes that occupied the gentle depressions.
Later, these deposits hardened mainly into red siltstone
and sandstone, but thin beds of gravel were cemented to
form conglomerate, and thin beds of limestone formed in some
of the shallow lakes by the precipitation of the mineral calcium
carbonate. These rocks, which comprise the Chinle (pronounced
Chin-lee) Formation, are only 80 to 100 feet thick in
the Monument but are as much as 700 feet thick near Moab,
Utah, southwest of the Uncompahgre Plateau, where the entire
formation is present. There, the Chinle rests on still older
Triassic and Paleozoic rocks&mdash;all absent in the Monument for
the reasons noted previously. In some parts of the Plateau,
sandstone or conglomerate beds in the lower part of the Chinle
yield uranium ore, but these beds were not deposited in or near
the Monument.</p>
<p>The red color of the Chinle and some of the overlying rocks is
caused by minute amounts of iron oxide&mdash;the same pigment
used in rouge and red barn paint. Various oxides of iron, some
including water, produce not only brick red but also pink,
salmon, brown, buff, yellow, and even green or bluish green.
This does not imply that the rocks could be considered as
sources of iron ore, for the merest trace of iron, generally only 1
to 3 percent, is enough to produce even the darkest shades of
red.</p>
<p>Because it is soft, the Chinle is easily eroded into steep
slopes at the foot of high sandstone cliffs in all canyons of the
Monument and on top of the high bluffs that face The Redlands.
It also forms the broad base of Independence Monument.
Rim Rock Drive crosses the Chinle three times in the
lower part of Fruita Canyon and twice in No Thoroughfare
Canyon.</p>
<p>Fossil reptile bones, petrified wood, and freshwater shells
come from the Chinle in parts of Arizona and Utah. Reptiles
probably roamed the Monument in Chinle time, but their remains
have not been located.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p020a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="131" />
</div>
<p>Still later in the
Triassic Period the Monument became
part of a vast desert. Winds blowing from the northwest
brought great quantities of fine sand and piled them up into
large dunes like those in the Sahara or in Great Sand Dunes
National Monument in Colorado. But like all deserts, it was
not always dry&mdash;occasional rainstorms produced many small
lakes and ponds. Some of the sand was washed into these lakes
or ponds and settled in level layers. This huge sandpile eventually
hardened into the buff and light-red sandstone that we
now know as the Wingate. The shapes of the old dunes are indicated
by the steep dips of sand layers, called crossbeds,
which stand out in sharp contrast to the nearly level layers
formed in the lakes and ponds (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>).</p>
<p>The spectacular scenery of Colorado National Monument
owes its existence largely to the 350-foot cliffs of the Wingate
Sandstone (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) and to the desert climate, which allows us
to see virtually every foot of the vividly colored rocks and has
made possible the creation and preservation of such a wide
variety of fantastic sculptures. A wetter climate would have
produced a far different and smoother landscape in which most
of the rocks and land forms would have been hidden by
vegetation.</p>
<p>Eroded remnants of the Wingate form most of the named
rock features of the Monument and are shown in many of the
photographs. Independence Monument&mdash;a towering slab of
sandstone that resembles a bridge pier (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>)&mdash;is all that is left
of a high narrow wall that once connected the point east of Independence
View with the high mesa north of the slab and
which once separated the two entrances of Monument Canyon.
In a few thousand years this remnant, too, may be gone.</p>
<p>Vertical cliffs and shafts of the Wingate Sandstone endure
only where the top of the formation is capped by beds of the
next younger rock unit&mdash;the Kayenta Formation. The Kayenta
is much more resistant to erosion than the Wingate, so even a
few feet of the Kayenta, such as the cap on top of Independence
Monument, protect the rock beneath. Once this cap has
been eroded away, the underlying Wingate weathers into
rounded domes, such as the Coke Ovens.</p>
<p>Cold Shivers Point (<a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>)&mdash;a toadstool shaped cap of sandstone
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
of the Kayenta above a vertical cliff of the Wingate&mdash;is
perhaps the most aptly titled feature of the Monument.</p>

</div>
<p>The Coke Ovens (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) and Squaw Fingers were formed
partly because most of the caprock of Kayenta has been
weathered away and also because the brittle rocks were
cracked along an evenly spaced set of vertical joints. These
joints trend northward between the two named features. More
rapid weathering along these joints helped form the separate
rounded domes or spires between them. Similarly, northwestward-trending
vertical joints connect and helped shape Kissing
Couple, Pipe Organ, and Sentinal Spire.</p>

north-south joints has allowed erosion of the Wingate Sandstone to proceed
more rapidly along these zones of weakness and has helped create the four

Kayenta Formation has produced rounded tops on all but the left-hand shaft,
which is still protected by the Kayenta. Note alcoves and arches in cliff of the
Wingate beyond, the formation of the one on the right having been aided by
removal of the underlying soft Chinle Formation. Bench covered by pi&ntilde;on and

the bench is the Slick Rock Member of the Entrada Sandstone. The Coke Ovens
were named from their resemblance to the beehive-shaped brick ovens formerly
used to convert bituminous coal into coke for smelting iron. (Fig. 11)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Many of the cliff walls of the Wingate are vertical, some
even overhang, yet in some places the slopes are gentle enough
to hold talus and to be climbed (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). Why is this? The
answer to this question is given in a later section on &ldquo;Canyon
Cutting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arches or shallow caves weathered out of some cliff faces of
the Wingate, particularly where the underlying Chinle Formation
has been partly scoured away. Although there are no large
caves within the Monument, there are three in a row along the
road 3 miles west of the Glade Park Post Office. One of these
was inhabited until 1958 (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).</p>
<p>Many of the cliff faces of the Wingate are darkened or blackened
by desert varnish&mdash;a natural pigment of iron and
manganese oxides, silica, and clay.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Dinosaurs left their footprints in the sands of the Wingate in
parts of the Colorado Plateau, but no tracks or fossils have yet
been found in this formation in or near the Monument.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p022.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="209" />
</div>
<p>The arid climate
of Wingate time was followed
by a wet period, when streams from the northeast gradually
covered the sand dunes with mud, sand, and some gravel. The
sand and gravel of the stream channels were cemented into
hard sandstone and conglomerate, and the mud of the flood
plains hardened into red and purple siltstone and mudstone.
The resulting Kayenta Formation makes up the bench between
the two cliffs upon which the Visitor Center, campgrounds,
and most of scenic Rim Rock Drive were built. Here, nature
was kind, for this gently sloping bench was an ideal place to
build the road from which to look down into the deep chasms.
The Kayenta also caps the broad mesas between the canyons.
It is about 350 feet thick in eastern Utah, only 45 to 80 feet
thick in the Monument, and it is absent altogether not far east
of the Monument. The reasons for the eastward thinning and
ultimate disappearance of the Kayenta and some younger
rocks are given in the <a href="#c19">next section</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>As noted earlier, the sandstone beds and lenses of the
Kayenta generally are coarser grained (some even contain
small pebbles) and much harder than the underlying Wingate
Sandstone&mdash;particularly the lower beds of the Kayenta, which
serve as a protective capping, as shown in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a> and
in many of the other photographs. Unlike the dominantly fine
grained, well sorted, windblown sands of the Wingate, the
coarser stream-laid sands of the Kayenta are angular and poorly
sorted, so that small grains fill spaces between larger ones.
Moreover, in addition to the calcite cement (which also holds
together the sand grains in the Wingate and Entrada Sandstones),
most of the sand grains and pebbles in the Kayenta are
covered by interconnected &ldquo;overgrowths&rdquo; of silica (SiO&#8322;),
which make up about 10 percent of the rocks and serve as a
nearly insoluble hard cement.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The combination of the coarse and fine grains and interlocking
silica &ldquo;overgrowths&rdquo; makes the Kayenta one of the
most resistant rocks in the Colorado Plateau.</p>
<p>In distant views of weathered outcrops the Kayenta appears
to consist mainly of thin beds or lenses of sandstone, which indeed
it does, but in some fresh exposures, such as roadcuts, the
highly lenticular red flood-plain deposits form striking
features which may wedge out from 3 or 4 feet thick to a
featheredge within horizontal distances of only a few feet (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>).</p>
<p>The Kayenta has yielded fossil bones of dinosaurs and other
reptiles in northeastern Arizona and freshwater shells in eastern
Utah. As yet, however, no fossils have been reported from
it in or near the Monument.</p>

</div>
<p>Following the wet interval when the Kayenta
Formation was deposited over wide areas of the Colorado
Plateau by streams, the Plateau once again became a vast
desert, and this time the dry climate persisted from the Late
Triassic into the Jurassic. The howling winds piled up enormous
sand dunes, layer upon layer, to a total thickness of more
than 2,200 feet at Zion National Park, and as much as 500 feet
remains in eastern Utah and parts of southwestern Colorado.
This immense sandpile eventually was cemented by calcite
into the Navajo Sandstone.</p>

this sandstone thins to the northeast, and is absent entirely at
about the Utah-Colorado State line, some 35 miles southwest
of the Monument. Thus, in the Monument, the Navajo, most of
the Kayenta, and the lower part of the Entrada Sandstone are
missing at another gap in the rock record, as shown in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>.</p>

<p>How is it possible that the Navajo Sandstone is more than
2,200 feet thick in Zion National Park, is several hundred feet
thick in much of the Plateau in Utah and parts of southwestern
Colorado, yet is absent entirely, together with a considerable
thickness of younger rocks in and near Colorado National
Monument? How much of the missing strata once were present
in the Monument is not known, but it seems clear that at
least part was present but was eroded away before the Entrada
Sandstone was deposited. There is evidence<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> that following
the deposition and consolidation of the Navajo Sandstone the
Plateau and adjacent areas were uplifted, tilted gently westward,
and eroded for a considerable period of time. Erosion
naturally was most pronounced in the eastern areas, including
the Monument, where the uplift was greatest. Thus, in the
northeastern part of the Plateau all the Navajo and most of the
Kayenta were eroded away, and erosion continued there while
the lowest member of the Entrada, the Dewey Bridge Member,
and the lower part of the overlying Slick Rock Member were
being laid down in the Moab, Utah, area.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> This old erosion surface
is clearly visible in many places along the cliff wall on the
southwest side of Rim Rock Drive between the Visitor Center
and Kissing Couple.</p>
<p>The reduction in thickness of the Navajo Sandstone from
southwest to northeast and absence of the Navajo and some
younger rocks in and near the Monument are shown on an isometric
(three dimensional) block diagram prepared by artist
John R. Stacy and me, which is displayed in the Museum of the
Visitor Center. This block diagram portrays the surface and
subsurface rocks from Zion National Park, Utah, to Black Canyon
of the Gunnison National Monument, Colo., via Capitol
Reef National Park, the Henry Mountains, and Colorado National
Monument. Throughout the Plateau and parts of adjacent
areas, the erosion surface on top of the Navajo Sandstone
is covered by scattered pebbles of chert&mdash;a hard variety of silica
(SiO&#8322;) derived from cherty beds of freshwater limestone in
the Navajo.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> Where the Navajo has been completely eroded
away and the ancient erosion surface is on the Kayenta Formation,
as in Colorado National Monument, scattered pebbles
(some of which are chert) derived from the conglomerate lenses
in the Kayenta are found locally on the old surface.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>

</div>
<p>In Middle Jurassic time the land now called central
Utah, which then was the eroded surface of the Navajo Sandstone,
sank beneath an arm of a shallow sea that came in from
the north, and most of the area remained beneath this sea until
Late Jurassic time. Sediment carried into this sea and into
bordering lagoons and estuaries later hardened into the sedimentary
rocks of the Carmel Formation, Entrada Sandstone,
and Curtis and Summerville Formations. The Carmel and Curtis
contain abundant marine fossils of Middle Jurassic age,
and in central Utah the intervening unfossiliferous Entrada
also is believed to have been deposited in or near the sea, and
the unfossiliferous Summerville Formation probably was deposited
upon a tidal flat that was submerged part of the time.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c21">Deposits and Events East of the Sea</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p025a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="181" />
</div>
<p>In eastern Utah,
east of the ancient Jurassic
sea, the Entrada Sandstone is
entirely unfossiliferous, was partly
water laid and partly wind blown, and has been divided into
three distinctive parts, which in ascending order are the
Dewey Bridge, Slick Rock, and Moab Members.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> In and near
the Colorado National Monument, the long period of erosion
discussed in a preceding section probably continued well into
the Jurassic, so only the upper part of the Slick Rock Member
and the overlying Moab Member were deposited on the eroded
surface of what little remained of the Kayenta Formation (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The Slick Rock Member was named from its occurrence at
and near the mining town of Slick Rock, Colo., which originally
was named after the appearance of the rock because it generally
forms slick, smooth cliffs. It reminds one of the chicken
and egg conundrum. The Slick Rock is composed mainly of
sand dunes that were piled up on the eastern shore of the
Jurassic sea by winds blowing from the northeast. Occasional
rainy spells created lakes and ponds in which some of the sand
was laid down in level beds. This pile of sand later hardened
into the cliff-forming Slick Rock Member, which looks something
like the Wingate but is generally only half as thick,
weathers into less abrupt cliffs, is mostly salmon red, and is
almost free of joints. The joints in the Wingate (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) probably
resulted from the uplift and tilting of the Plateau before
the long period of pre-Entrada erosion; whereas the land
seems to have been more stable during Entrada time. The
Slick Rock is cemented with calcium carbonate (CaCO&#8323;), which
is soluble even in weak acid, such as rain or snow water containing
dissolved carbon dioxide. For this reason solution
openings or pits occur in some of the cliff faces, the most
striking of which are those shown near the top of <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>.</p>
<p>The Slick Rock Member of the Entrada Sandstone forms a
line of cliffs and isolated monoliths that are second in height
and grandeur only to those of the Wingate. The Member is
best displayed southwest of Rim Rock Drive between the
Visitor Center and the Coke Ovens and along the western arm
of Ute Canyon (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>). It also forms the Saddlehorn just south
of the camp and picnic grounds near the Visitor Center (<a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>).
Most of the smooth cliff faces show both the steeply dipping
crossbeds of the old sand dunes and the flat-lying beds of
the lake or pond deposits.</p>

<p>The overlying Moab Member of the Entrada is a white level-bedded
sandstone that generally weathers into stairsteps or
ledges. One of the best exposures of the Moab Member is
shown in <a href="#fig17">figure 17</a>, but good exposures also are seen along the
west side of Rim Rock Drive just northeast of the Coke Ovens
Overlook. In some places the Moab Member forms cliffs continuous
with those of the underlying Slick Rock Member. It
appears to consist of hardened beach or lagoon sand that was
deposited along the eastern shore of the sea, which suggests
that the sea extended farther east during Moab and Summerville
times than it did during Dewey Bridge and Slick Rock
times. Like the Slick Rock, the Moab also is cemented by
calcium carbonate, but the lower sandstone ledges of the Moab
Member are more resistant to erosion than the Slick Rock
Member, so the Moab helps preserve the underlying cliffs. The
top of the Moab Member forms patches of bare pavement east
of the Monument, known as the &ldquo;Slick Rim,&rdquo; which may be observed
from the Little Park Road.</p>

distinctly mottled appearance, wherein much of the color has
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
been leached to white, but irregular splotches of color appear in
the dominantly white upper part, and white splotches appear
in the colored part, as shown in <a href="#fig18">figure 18</a>. By way of contrast,
in an outcrop of the two members of the Entrada about 2 miles
north of the Glade Park Store and Post Office (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>), the entire
Slick Rock Member is as white as the Moab Member, and
the former is white for some distance to the east. Why is the
salmon color entirely missing from the Slick Rock near Glade
Park, partly missing in <a href="#fig18">figure 18</a>, but present virtually everywhere
else in and near the Monument? The answers to this
seeming mystery involve events that occurred long ago, so
only the high points will be touched upon here.</p>

</div>
<p>It seems reasonable to suppose that the Slick Rock Member
at both localities originally was salmon colored or pink, as it is
everywhere else, but that later, the coloring agent, red ferric
iron oxide (Fe&#8322;O&#8323;), was chemically reduced, or leached to ferrous
iron oxide (FeO), by acidic ground water, and was carried
away to the northeast by the slowly moving ground water. But
as I have already pointed out, the cliff exposures of the sandstones
are now bone dry, so what happened to the ground
water and why was it acidic here and not elsewhere?</p>

<p class="pcap">WHITE ENTRADA SANDSTONE, in outcrop just east of gravel road about
2 miles north of Glade Park Store and Post Office. Reasons for absence of
salmon color in Slick Rock Member are given in text. (Fig. 19)</p>
</div>
<p>Before the cutting of the deep canyons of the Monument,
which followed the last major uplifts of the region accompanied
by bending and breaking of the rocks, the now dry
sandstones were saturated with ground water that moved very
slowly northeastward. Somewhere to the southwest the Entrada
Sandstone seemingly took in water containing dissolved
hydrogen sulfide gas (H&#8322;S), changing the ground water to a
weak acid. The H&#8322;S could have been produced by a type of
anaerobic bacteria that has the ability to reduce dissolved sulfates
(SO&#8324;&#8315;&sup2;) in water to the dissolved hydrogen sulfide gas,
thereby obtaining needed oxygen.</p>
<p>The next questions you might logically ask are (1) if the
above deductions have any merit, how do we know the acid
water was caused by dissolved hydrogen sulfide,<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> (2) what is
the source of the sulfate ions (SO&#8324;&#8315;&sup2;) from which the H&#8322;S was
obtained, and (3) why is the color of the Slick Rock Member in
<a href="#fig19">figure 19</a> completely reduced to white whereas that in <a href="#fig18">figure 18</a>
is only partly reduced in the upper part?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Although the ground waters from artesian wells in the
Grand Junction area contain small amounts of sulfate as do
most ground waters, the amount needed for the results observed
more likely came from solution of the common mineral
gypsum (calcium sulfate containing some water, CaSO&#8324;&middot;2H&#8322;O).
The overlying Summerville and Morrison Formations contain
some gypsum in many places in Utah, so it is not improbable
that these formations contain gypsum locally in Colorado. If
so, sulfate-bearing water could have percolated downward into
the Entrada at some point southwest of Glade Park. But as
this must have happened several million years ago, the clues as
to just where this occurred have grown quite cold.</p>
<p>Seemingly, the color in the Slick Rock Member near and east
of Glade Park was entirely removed by the process described,
but the very slow moving ground water had time to leach only
the upper part of the Slick Rock (the most permeable part) in
Ute Canyon before the process was halted forever by the draining
of water from these beds by canyon cutting.</p>
<p>Shortly before the Jurassic sea to the west dried up, silt,
mud, and some sand were carried into either a shallow arm of
the sea or a broad bay or lagoon near it, and later the silt, mud,
and sand hardened to become the Summerville Formation. The
Summerville is only 40 to 60 feet thick in the Monument but is
much thicker in Utah.</p>
<p>The Summerville Formation is so soft that it weathers very
rapidly and hence is exposed at only a few places. It is best displayed
in the high roadcut at Artists Point and along the road
to the south for the next mile (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>), but it is also exposed in
roadcuts along the west arm of Ute Canyon. Even the thinnest
beds of the Summerville can be traced for hundreds of yards,
and individual beds have a nearly constant thickness for such
distances. This greatly facilitated the detailed measurement of
a section of the Summerville<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> by my son Bill and me from
Artists Point to the base of the overlying Morrison Formation
about a mile south. Using a 6-foot folding steel rule we measured
and described each thin bed from some key bed at about
ground level to one at eye level, followed the upper key bed
southward to ground level, then repeated the process until the
entire 54 feet had been measured and described.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The Summerville at the type locality in the San Rafael Swell,
Utah, is much thicker than in the Monument and contains
many chocolate-brown beds; but the Summerville exhibits the
same lateral continuity of even the thinnest beds. Thin sedimentary
beds of such uniform thickness are thought to have
accumulated in relatively quiet bodies of water. If you look at
the undersides of some of the blocks of hard light-gray sandstone
that have broken off, you may see corrugations like
those on some metal barn roofs. These are ripplemarks produced
by wave or current action while the sand was still loose,
which indicates that the water was not always entirely quiet.
Although much of the Summerville is red, you will see beds of
many other colors including gray, blue gray, greenish gray,
chocolate brown, and reddish brown.</p>

</div>
<p>In Late Jurassic time the sea to the west eventually
dried up, either because it was filled with sediments or because
the land rose above sea level, or both. This brought about a
change from the parallel bedding in the marginal marine environment
of the Summerville to irregular stream-channel
sandstones, flood-plain silts and muds, and freshwater lake
deposits.</p>
<p>Streams from higher lands to the south brought in mud, silt,
and sand that piled up hundreds of feet thick over thousands
of square miles, including the Monument. These sediments
were later compacted into the brightly colored siltstone, mudstone,
sandstone, and limestone now known as the Morrison
Formation. The colors are about the same as those of the Summerville.
Algae and other microscopic organisms extracted calcium
carbonate from the lake waters, and when they died this
material settled on the lake bottoms to make limestone.</p>
<p>The soft siltstone and mudstone of the Morrison Formation
weather rapidly into steep or fairly steep slopes, but the harder
beds of sandstone, most of which are in the lower third of the
formation, known as the Salt Wash Member, are sculptured
into bold ledges or low cliffs. The generally softer upper two-thirds
of the formation is called the Brushy Basin Member.
The Morrison is best exposed in and southeast of The Redlands,
where the bare rocks are carved into badlands like the
famous ones of South Dakota. Both the Fruita Canyon and No
Thoroughfare Canyon approaches to the Monument pass
typical badlands in the Morrison. The entire 600 feet of this
formation is best seen in the high bluff on the east side of the
mouth of No Thoroughfare Canyon (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>).</p>

<p>In parts of the Colorado Plateau southwest of the Uncompahgre
Plateau, the sandstone lenses in the Salt Wash
Member of the Morrison contain uranium and vanadium ore
associated with carbonaceous matter, including coalified
wood. No ores have been found in or near the Monument presumably
because such carbonaceous matter, which helped precipitate
the ores, is lacking on the northeastern side of the
Uncompahgre Plateau.</p>
<p>Some of the beds of siltstone and mudstone in the Brushy
Basin Member of the Morrison shown in <a href="#fig21">figure 21</a> contain bentonite,
a clay derived from the decomposition of volcanic ash,
which indicates the presence of active volcanos in or near the
Plateau at the time these beds were deposited. Bentonite
swells when wetted, so it is widely used in well-drilling muds,
sealing canals, etc. Some bentonitic material has been dug
from the Brushy Basin along the Little Park Road just south
of the point from which the photograph in <a href="#fig21">figure 21</a> was taken
and was used for sealing irrigation canals in the Grand Valley.</p>
<p>The Morrison is not well exposed in the Monument, as the
formation is restricted to the higher parts where most of it is
hidden by vegetation. The lower part is seen in roadcuts and
outcropping ledges along a high stretch of Rim Rock Drive
between Artists Point and the head of the west arm of Ute
Canyon, where sandstone lenses in the Salt Wash Member are
especially thick.</p>
<p>The climate during Morrison time was wet enough to
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
support abundant vegetation along the many lakes and
streams&mdash;at least enough to feed the hungry dinosaurs and
other reptiles that roamed the area. Many bones and parts of
several skeletons of dinosaurs have been found in the Morrison
at several places in The Redlands not far northeast and northwest
of the Monument.</p>
<p>The most famous dinosaur locality near the Monument is
Riggs Hill where, in 1900, the late Elmer S. Riggs of the Field
Columbian Museum (now Field Museum of Natural History)
dug out part of the first known skeleton of a huge <i>Brachiosaurus</i>
(<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). This discovery made quite a splash in the
scientific world, for it was the first and only type of dinosaur
found whose front legs were longer than its hind legs. The
fossilized thigh bone (femur) alone is 6 feet 8 inches long and
weighs 549 pounds; the arm bone (humerus), though incomplete,
is even longer. The ribs are 9 feet long. A bronze plaque
now marks the site of the excavation (<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>).</p>
<p>In 1901, Riggs removed all but the forepart of a skeleton of
<i>Apatosaurus</i> from the southeast side of a large hill of the Morrison
Formation just south of the old Fruita bridge. Riggs also
found remains of <i>Diplodocus</i>, <i>Camarasaurus</i>, and <i>Morosaurus</i>,
and, in 1937, Al Look, prominent writer and amateur paleontologist
of Grand Junction, and Edwin L. Holt, an instructor
in Mesa College at Grand Junction, found the closely associated
remains of <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Stegosaurus</i>, and <i>Brachiosaurus</i>
at the western end of Riggs Hill. Dinosaurs generally are
thought of as huge creatures&mdash;many were huge indeed (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>)&mdash;but
they came in various sizes and some were quite small.</p>
<p>An interesting Late Jurassic vertebrate fossil locality in the
Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, about 3 miles
northwest of the West Entrance of the Monument and about 3
miles southwest of Fruita, was discovered in June 1975 by
George Callison, Associate Professor of Biology and Research
Associate in Vertebrate Paleontology at the California State
University at Long Beach. During the summers of 1975 and
1976 Dr. Callison and his assistants removed the closely associated
skeletal remains of many small, primitive mammals and
both small and large dinosaurs and other reptiles. Part of the
results were presented in an unpublished manuscript.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> During
the summer of 1977 and later, additional mammalian fossils
were removed by Callison and assistants and additional reptilian
fossils were removed by Lance Erickson, paleontologist

<p>The close association of Late Jurassic mammalian and reptilian
fossils, as found at the Fruita site, is of considerable interest
and importance, but is by no means unique, for similar
associations occur elsewhere in Colorado, and in Wyoming,
Europe, and Africa. Of those in the United States, the quarry
at Como Bluff, near Laramie, Wyo., is considered by most of
the experts to be the most outstanding. Of the material unearthed
at Fruita thus far, which includes bones of some of the
large dinosaurs found earlier by Riggs, remains of some of the
smaller dinosaurs and a complete skull of the moderately large
flesh eater <i>Ceratosaurus</i> are considered the most important.</p>
<p>Freshwater clam and snail shells abound in some beds of the
Morrison, particularly in limestones, and occur sparingly in
other types of beds. The shells occur mainly in The Redlands,
particularly about 1&frac12; miles west of the Fruita bridge. Some of
these shells that are filled with agate are sought by rockhounds.</p>

<p>The wet climate of Late Jurassic time was followed by
arid or semiarid climate in the Early Cretaceous. Streams continued
to deposit gravel, sand, silt, and mud, but at a much
slower rate. These deposits eventually hardened into the conglomerate,
sandstone, and green shale or siltstone of the Burro
Canyon Formation. This formation, together with part of the
overlying Dakota Sandstone, caps Black Ridge, the highest
part of the Monument (7,000 feet) about a mile west of the
Coke Ovens. Several airway beacons on this high ridge may be
seen for many miles. The Burro Canyon is best seen below the
Monument on the west side of Monument Road along the
lower part of No Thoroughfare Canyon, where it is about 60
feet thick (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>).</p>

<p>A few fossil plants and shells have come from the Burro Canyon

greater precipitation, where food was more abundant. Some
dinosaurs may have lived in the area at this time, but their
bones either were not fossilized or they have not yet been

</div>
<p>Deposition of the Burro Canyon Formation was brought
to a close by another uplift of the Plateau, and of course the uplift
was followed by another period of erosion, which continued
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
through the end of Early Cretaceous time. As noted in the caption
for <a href="#fig24">figure 24</a>, seemingly all but 58 feet of the Burro Canyon
was eroded away, but 120 feet remains along East Creek,
only about 12 miles to the southeast, which suggests that the
old erosion surface was a bit uneven. That this period of erosion
was of considerable duration is suggested by the abundance
of the white clay mineral, kaolinite, beneath and in the
overlying white basal conglomerate of the Dakota Sandstone.
This type of clay commonly results from prolonged weathering
of many types of rocks and indicates that the period of pre-Dakota
erosion was of long duration.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c25">Peat Bogs</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p033b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="318" />
</div>
<p>By the beginning of Late Cretaceous time the eroded
surface of the Monument was part of a low plain near sea level,
and the sea was gradually encroaching from the east or northeast.
Gravel and sand carried in by streams combined with the
white kaolinite on the surface to form the 40-foot basal conglomerate
of the Dakota Sandstone (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>).</p>
<p>As the land gradually subsided nearer to sea level, swamps
which were formed along the coast supported considerable
vegetation. As the trees and plants died and were covered by
silt and mud, they gradually changed to peat which finally became
compacted into coal and brown or black coaly shale containing
plant remains. You can dig out some of this coal and
perhaps find some plant remains near the top of the west canyon
wall just below the highest sandstone bed in <a href="#fig24">figure 24</a>,
which is outside the Monument.</p>
<p>For awhile the coast alternately sank slightly below and rose
slightly above sea level. Beach sand covered the swamp deposits,
then more swamp deposits covered the sand. Some of
the sand contains seashells, such as oysters and clams.</p>
<p>Except on Black Ridge, the Dakota has been entirely eroded
from the Monument, but it crops out with the underlying
Burro Canyon in a series of low hills south of the Colorado
River. The Dakota Sandstone is about 200 feet thick.</p>

</div>
<p>Still later in the Cretaceous Period the whole region
sank beneath the sea and stayed there a long time. Silt and
limy mud were piled layer upon layer on the sea floor and hardened
into the gray and black Mancos Shale. Thin layers of sand
were cemented into sandstone, and layers of calcium-carbonate
mud became chalk or limestone. Seashells and bones of sharks
and seagoing reptiles have been found in the Mancos in many
places.</p>
<p>The Mancos and all younger rocks have been stripped off the
Monument, but they may be seen one after the other as you
travel northeastward. Thin remnants of the Mancos cap low
hills just south of the Colorado River, and the entire 3,800 feet
of the Mancos underlies the Grand Valley and Book Cliffs. The
upper part is clearly exposed in the towering, barren Book
Cliffs, where the soft shale is protected by a caprock of hard
sandstone&mdash;the lowermost unit of the overlying Late Cretaceous
Mesaverde Group (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>).</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p034a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="178" />
</div>
<p>Slow uplift of the Plateau, including the Monument
region, caused the gradual retreat of the Mancos sea. Deposition
of mud on the sea bottom gave way to deposition of
beach sand, coal swamps, and then more beach sand and coal
swamps. Finally, in Late Cretaceous time, the sea withdrew
entirely, never again to return to the Colorado Plateau region.</p>
<p>Streams deposited sand, silt, and mud on the newly uplifted
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
coastal areas. All these deposits, including some high-grade
bituminous coal that was formed in the swamps, we now know
as the Mesaverde Group. The thick cliff-forming sandstones of
this unit are beautifully displayed in DeBeque Canyon of the
Colorado River between Palisade and DeBeque, just upstream
from the Grand Valley. There are several active coal mines in
the Mesaverde between Palisade and Cameo, and outcrops of
coal may be seen on the east side of the road just south of
Cameo. The electric generating station of the Public Service
Company of Colorado at Cameo is conveniently situated over a
coal mine and next to the Colorado River, which supplies cooling

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p036.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="362" />
</div>
<p>The end of the Cretaceous Period was also the end of the
dinosaurs. Exactly why the &ldquo;terrible lizards&rdquo; died out after
dominating the world for more than 150 million years is not
known for sure, but many guesses have been made.</p>
<p>One likely idea is that widespread uplift and mountain building
that began late in Cretaceous time, accompanied by
changes in climate, may have greatly reduced the supply of
soft edible plants. If so, it is easy to imagine how huge dinosaurs
accustomed to a ton or more of lush plant food each day
would soon starve to death.</p>
<p>Many dinosaurs were vegetarians. As they died out, the
flesheaters, such as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, soon ran short of food
also, and probably began to eat each other. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
closely resembled the Jurassic <i>Allosaurus</i> shown in <a href="#fig23">figure 23</a>,
except that <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> was much larger and more formidable&mdash;in
fact it probably was the most terrible predator
that ever roamed the surface of the Earth. The dinosaurs had
become too highly specialized to their environment to adapt
themselves to changes of this kind.</p>
<p>Another fascinating notion is that the growing population of
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
small primitive mammals devoured dinosaur eggs (which were
left unattended like those of turtles and alligators) nearly as
fast as mamma dinosaur could lay them. But whatever the
reason, it is clear that some worldwide condition caused the
gradual extinction of the ponderous over-specialized dinosaurs
and allowed the rise to power of the next types of animals
destined to rule the Earth&mdash;the brainier and more adaptable
mammals.</p>
<p>At this time the rocks were gently bent into upfolds, called
anticlines or arches, and downfolds, called synclines or basins
(<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>). One upfold that began to take form was the Uncompahgre
arch, the crest of which shapes Pi&ntilde;on Mesa just south
of the Monument. But this gentle upfold was to grow larger
and to have its flanks wrinkled and broken in the next geologic
era&mdash;the Cenozoic.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Cenozoic Era 65 million years
ago&mdash;give or take a few million years&mdash;marked the beginning
of a long span of geologic time during which mammals became
the ruling land animals. Remains of some small primitive
mammals have been found in Mesozoic rocks (<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>), but these
tiny newcomers did not have a chance to flourish until the formidable
dinosaurs died out.</p>
<p>The Cenozoic Era is divided into the long Tertiary
Period&mdash;The Age of Mammals&mdash;and the short (about 2 million
years) Quaternary Period&mdash;The Age of Man. The Tertiary in
turn is divided into five epochs&mdash;the Paleocene, Eocene,
Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>). Events during parts
of the Tertiary Period had an important bearing upon the
Monument even though no rocks of this period now occur in
the area.</p>

<p>The broad inland basins
that were formed late in the
Cretaceous Period received
sand, silt, and mud brought in
by streams from the uplifted or
folded areas. These materials became
compacted into the Wasatch Formation&mdash;the red or pink rock
from which Bryce Canyon National Park was sculptured. One
such basin lay just northeast of the Monument. The Monument
probably was covered by some of these stream deposits
after the main basin was partly filled.</p>
<p>The mammals that roamed the area during the Paleocene
Epoch were primitive, but more advanced forms appeared
later, in Eocene time. Some of their fossil remains have been
found in the Wasatch Formation in Plateau Creek Valley north
of Grand Mesa and near Rifle, about 60 miles northeast of
Grand Junction. The entire 5,000 feet of the Wasatch may be
seen along U.S. Highway I-70 between the towns of DeBeque
and Grand Valley, and much of it helps support towering
Grand and Battlement Mesas.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c31">Lake Uinta</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p037b.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="195" />
</div>
<p>In Eocene time
the northern part of the
Colorado Plateau sagged
downward and gradually
filled with water until it
became a huge lake, now known as Lake Uinta. The waters in it
teemed with plants and animals, particularly micro-organisms
such as algae, whose remains, coated with calcium carbonate,
settled to the bottom along with the sand, silt, and mud
washed into the lake by streams. These sediments compacted
into the remarkable Green River Formation which contains,
among many rock types, large deposits of rich oil shale.</p>
<p>The light-colored Green River Formation, which is about
3,800 feet thick, may be seen from U.S. Highway I-70 in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
upper part of the towering Roan Cliffs on the northwest side of
the Colorado River between DeBeque and Rifle. It also underlies
the volcanic caprock of Grand and Battlement Mesas.
John R. Donnell, of the U.S. Geological Survey, estimated that
the oil shale in the Piceance Creek Basin, northwest of the
Colorado River alone, contains more than one trillion barrels of
oil. The Monument was at or near the south shore of this lake,
and may have been covered with a few hundred feet of the
Green River Formation.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c32">The Mountains Rise Again</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p038.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="148" />
</div>
<p>Lakes, like mountains, are temporary things. Even
as lakes are forming, sediment begins to fill them until ultimately
they are obliterated. So it was with Lake Uinta.
Sometime after this lake dried up, the Earth&rsquo;s crust again
became restless. The gentle folds that were formed late in the
Cretaceous were lifted higher and bent more sharply, and the
flanks of some folds were wrinkled and broken (figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <a href="#fig28">28</a>).
The sharply bent or broken rocks along the northeastern
border of the Monument are thought to have been deformed
mainly at this time, but in part both earlier and later. That pronounced
folding of the rocks followed the deposition of the
Eocene Green River Formation is clearly shown along the
Grand Hogback monocline between the towns of Rifle and
Meeker, Colorado, where the once flat lying beds of the Green
River and Wasatch Formations now stand vertical.</p>
<p>The folds and faults along the northeastern border of the
Monument, which are shown on the geologic map (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>), are
discussed briefly here&mdash;more details are given later in &ldquo;Trips
through and around the Monument.&rdquo; The folded and faulted
northeastern border of the Monument, which is shown in
<a href="#fig29">figure 29</a> and in several ensuing photographs, is believed to
have resulted from renewed uplift of the area southwest of the
folds and faults, including the Monument. The Redlands fault
(figs. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <a href="#fig38">38</a>, <a href="#fig40">40</a>, <a href="#fig41">41</a>) generally is a normal fault but locally
is a reverse fault, as discussed on <a href="#Page_92">page 92</a> and as shown in
<a href="#fig40">figure 40</a> and in the cross section of <a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>. This fault has a
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
maximum vertical displacement of 700 or 800 feet, but dies out
in scissors fashion at each end. Beyond the end of the Redlands
fault in the upper right of <a href="#fig29">figure 29</a> may be seen another unbroken
monocline. A close-up view of the northwestern end of
this fold in shown in <a href="#fig30">figure 30</a>.</p>

<p class="pcap">COMMON TYPES OF FAULTS. Top, normal, or gravity, fault which generally
results from tension in and lengthening of a segment of the Earth&rsquo;s crust, which
allows the lower block to subside. However, some normal faults, particularly
some that are vertical or nearly so, may result from uplift of the upper block.
Low-angle reverse faults generally are called overthrust faults or simply overthrusts.
In both the normal and reverse faults note amount of displacement and
repetition of strata. Displacement of such faults may range from a few inches to
many thousands of feet, and in overthrusts may reach many miles. From

<p>At this point in our story it might be well to point out that
the folding and faulting of the rocks just described occurred

</div>
<p>Grand and Battlement Mesas, respectively east
and northeast of the Monument, are capped by several resistant
thick flows of dark basaltic lava. The molten rock
welled up through fissures at the east end of Grand Mesa and
flowed westward and northwestward over the eroded surface
of Eocene rocks. Radiometric dating of a sample of the basalt
indicated an age of 9&frac12; million years plus or minus half a
million years, placing the event in the Miocene Epoch of
the Tertiary Period (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>).</p>
<p>A small remnant of the lava on the crest of the Roan Cliffs
just southwest of the present town of Grand Valley indicates
that the flows crossed this part of the ancestral Colorado River
Valley and may have pushed the young stream westward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The lava flows are about 800 feet thick on the eastern part of
Grand Mesa but are only about 200 feet thick above the western
rim of the mesa. As the ancestral Gunnison River is believed
to be pre-Miocene in age, it is not known whether or not
the lava flows crossed the old river valley and reached as far
west as the Monument.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c34">Ancestral Colorado River</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p042.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="170" />
</div>
<p>During most of the
Pliocene Epoch the ancestral
Colorado River did not flow past
what is now Grand Junction; instead, it
joined with the ancestral Gunnison River about 10 miles
southeast of the present city, and the combined streams
flowed southwestward across the slowly rising Uncompahgre
arch through what was later to be called Unaweep Canyon (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>).
Southwest of the canyon, near the site of the present town
of Gateway, the ancestral Colorado River was joined by the
combined flows of the ancestral San Miguel River and the previously
diverted ancestral Dolores River, then it flowed northwestward
to what is now the mainstem of the Colorado River.</p>
<p>I have attempted to show my ideas of this ancient drainage
system as it may have existed in middle to late Pliocene time
in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>. But the stage was set for more spectacular drainage
changes to follow.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c35">Piracy on the High Plateaus</h3>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>Rivers, like people, do not always choose their courses
wisely. After a few million years of downcutting through the
soft sedimentary rocks, mainly what is now called the Mancos
Shale, the ancestral Colorado and Gunnison Rivers found
themselves cutting through the hard Proterozoic rocks in a
deep gorge athwart the slowly rising Uncompahgre arch,
which greatly slowed the downcutting power of the combined
streams. Note in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>A</i> that while the mighty ancestral
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
Colorado and Gunnison Rivers were in this frustrating predicament,
a young upstart tributary began cutting northward
from what is now the mouth of the Dolores River (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a><i>D</i>).
Although the combined main rivers could lower their channel
only very slowly because of the hard rock in Unaweep Canyon,
the tributary was able to cut downward and headward quite
rapidly through the soft Mancos Shale. It eventually cut
around the northwestward dipping Uncompahgre arch and
headed southeastward toward the ancestral Colorado River
near the present site of Palisade.</p>
<p>Then occurred an act of piracy that put to shame the
mightiest exploits of Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. In latest
Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene time additional uplift of the
Uncompahgre arch, an unusually large flood, or both, caused
the ancestral Colorado River to overflow its banks and spill
across a low shale divide into the headwaters of the tributary.
Some ponding may have preceded the spillover. With this
enormously increased supply of water, the tributary cut down
rapidly through the soft shale and captured the entire flow of
the Colorado River, but the ancestral Gunnison River still
flowed through Unaweep Canyon, as shown in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>B</i>.
Stream capture of this type is appropriately called &ldquo;piracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the piracy had not ended. Note in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>B</i> that the
&ldquo;new&rdquo; river sent out several tributaries, one of which headed
for and, with the aid of yet additional and greater uplift, soon
captured the ancestral Gunnison River, as shown in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>C</i>.
This second act of piracy left Unaweep Canyon really
&ldquo;high and dry&rdquo; except for small streams that carried off what
little water the canyon received from local rain and snow.
While these piracies were taking place, the Book Cliffs and the
edge of Grand Mesa gradually retreated away from the valley
because of erosion, and more of the Uncompahgre arch was
uncovered.</p>
<p>The rising Uncompahgre arch, whose renewed uplifts in
latest Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene times played such an important
role in the ultimate abandonment of ancestral Unaweep
Canyon, was asymmetric in that the crest was not in the
middle but was near the southwest side. Although sharp, locally
faulted monoclines are found on both sides of the arch, including
the part within the Monument, in general, the northeastern
flank has a rather gentle northeastward dip; whereas,
the southwestern flank of the arch also is bordered by normal
faults of considerable vertical displacement.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> Thus, after
abandonment, the minor drainage in Unaweep Canyon continued
to flow northeastward from a new divide near the southwestern
border, and ancestral West Creek began cutting northeastward
toward the new divide. The drainage pattern depicted
in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>C</i> differs slightly from my earlier interpretation
and results from additional fieldwork.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>

<h2 class="pcap" id="c36">The Age of Man</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p044.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="218" />
</div>
<p>Like the dinosaurs
before them, a few of the
Tertiary mammals were so long on
brawn and short on brains that they
evolved into grotesque monsters and overspecialized themselves
into early extinction. Fortunately, however, most of the
mammals evolved more slowly and moderately into the forms
we find today.</p>
<p>One group&mdash;the anthropoid primates&mdash;began to think, so
they developed their brains rather than their brawn, particularly
the Tertiary ancestors of man. Few remains of these
ancestors have been found in Tertiary rocks, but many more
have been discovered in rocks of the next geologic period&mdash;the
Quaternary. Thus, this period may properly be regarded as the
age of man, for man then began to dominate the Earth for better
or for worse.</p>
<p>The Quaternary&mdash;latest and shortest of the geologic
periods&mdash;is divided into the Pleistocene and Holocene (recent)
Epochs (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c37">The Ice Age</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p044a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="349" />
</div>
<p>During the Pleistocene Epoch, all continents of
the Northern Hemisphere and some of the Southern Hemisphere
were partly covered at least four times by huge glaciers.
Each glacial advance in Europe and North America was ended
by a warmer interval during which the glaciers melted and
retreated northward; then, vegetation and soil had time to become
re-established. Thus, the Pleistocene has properly been
called the ice age.</p>
<p>None of the continental glaciers reached the Monument or
the Uncompahgre Plateau, or arch, but small alpine glaciers
grew in the high Rocky Mountains to the east, sculpturing
sharp-crested peaks and ridges and forming beautiful valleys
and lakes. Many of the beautiful lakes on Grand Mesa were
formed by glaciation, but some near the edges were formed by
landslides.</p>
<p>The increased streamflow from the greater precipitation and
from melting alpine glaciers in the Rockies, particularly during
times of glacial retreat, helped the Colorado River cut through
the rocks faster, thus assisting in the formation of Colorado
National Monument as we see it today. The river carried
thousands of cubic miles of sediment to the Gulf of California,
including a lot of rock that once covered the Monument, and
the river is still actively at work on this immense earthmoving
project.</p>
<p>If the ancestral Colorado River carried sediment at about the
same rate as the present river since the building of Hoover
Dam, it may have carried about 3 cubic miles of sediment each
century. Now most of the rock debris is being dumped into
Lake Powell&mdash;the new reservoir behind Glen Canyon Dam.
When this, Lake Mead, and other reservoirs ultimately become
filled with sediment, the Gulf of California will again be the
burial ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>But other events during the Pleistocene also played a role in
shaping the area. The Uncompahgre arch was again uplifted
and deformed in the Pleistocene soon after the abandonment of
Unaweep Canyon. This caused added tilting of the strata and
more bending and breaking along some of the folds and faults
in the Monument.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c38">Capture of East Creek</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p045.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="157" />
</div>
<p>East Creek, which drains the northeastern half of
Unaweep Canyon, was forced to change its course during the
Pleistocene Epoch by another act of piracy. After capture of
the Gunnison River by the newly routed Colorado River, East
Creek joined the Gunnison by way of Cactus Park. Then, a
tributary of North East Creek headed southward and captured
East Creek, as shown in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>D</i>.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c39">Canyon Cutting</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p045a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="304" />
</div>
<p>When the Colorado River
was diverted into its new course
through the Grand Valley past the
Monument, the stream channel
seems to have been only about 600
to 800 feet higher than it is today,
but the present divide in Unaweep
Canyon is now about 2,500 feet
higher than the channel. The difference
of 1,700 to 1,900 feet was
caused by the additional uplift of the Uncompahgre arch during
the Pleistocene.</p>
<p>Thus, the Grand Valley and its tributary canyons, such as
those of Colorado National Monument, were cut since the
abandonment of Unaweep Canyon, probably mainly during the
Quaternary Period. This suggests that the cutting of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
Monument&rsquo;s canyons began only about 2 million years ago,
but that much of the canyon cutting occurred only a few hundred
thousand years ago. Indeed, the canyons are still slowly
being deepened, lengthened, and widened.</p>
<p>As you stand on any of the lookout points and gaze down
into the canyons of the Monument, you may well wonder how
such immense chasms could have been cut by such puny
streams that are dry most of the time. The streams flow only
for short periods after heavy thundershowers or after rapid
melting of snow. If you are lucky enough to see them flow, you
will notice that the water is red or brown because of the
suspended mud, silt, and sand. If the flow is large, you may see
or hear pebbles and cobbles rolling along the bed. Accordingly,
the streams and their cutting tools are slowly deepening the
channels. But, you may ask, how does this account for such
wide, broad-bottomed, cliff-walled canyons? Such streams act
mainly as storm sewers to carry off the rock debris formed by
other types of erosion.</p>
<p>When cutting first began, the Monument&rsquo;s canyons were
narrow, steep, and <span class="ss">V</span>-shaped. When the top of the hard, dark
Proterozoic rocks was reached, however, downcutting slowed
just as it had earlier in Unaweep Canyon. While the streams
were thus hung up, other erosional processes caused the cliff
walls to recede away from the streams, forming broad, flat-bottomed,
<span class="ss">U</span>-shaped canyons.</p>
<p>Recession of the cliffs away from the middle of the canyons
probably was caused partly by undercutting of the soft Chinle
Formation by wind and in places by streams. This allowed
slabs of the overlying Wingate Sandstone and younger rocks
to break off and fall into the canyons&mdash;eventually to break up
and to be carted off as sand and mud by streams.</p>
<p>But other processes are probably the ones chiefly responsible
for the present shape and width of the canyons. The summer
sun heats the cliff faces until they are hot to the touch, but
in the present desert climate of the Monument the rocks cool
rapidly after sundown. Oftentimes the hot cliff faces are
chilled rapidly by summer thundershowers. Repeated heating,
cooling, wetting, and drying causes expansion and contraction
of the rocks so that thin layers break off and fall. This process
goes on slowly even in winter on sun-facing cliffs, but it does
not occur on the cliffs that face away from the winter sun.</p>
<p>Even more important, perhaps, is the alternate freezing at
night and thawing by day on sun-facing cliff faces during the
winter. Water in cracks near the cliff faces alternately freezes
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
and melts, gradually prying off slabs of rock. Canyon walls
that are shaded from the sun most of the winter, however, stay
cold or frozen much of the winter; hence, they are not subject
to repeated heating and cooling or freezing and thawing. Thus,
you will notice that because of talus accumulation many such
canyon walls are sloping rather than vertical.</p>
<p>To illustrate the above conjectures concerning the cutting
and shaping of the canyons, let us consider several canyons
that trend in different directions. We have seen in <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a>
that the left side of northeastward trending Red Canyon is a
nearly vertical cliff that faces the sun most of the winter;
whereas, the right side, which is shaded most of the winter,
slopes gently enough to be climbed at many places. The sides
of Ute Canyon, which trends more nearly northward (<a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>),
slope about equally, as would be expected. However, the west
arm of the Canyon, which trends slightly southeastward, has
sides whose slopes differ markedly (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>).</p>
<p>This brings us to the remarkable transformation of the
original <span class="ss">V</span>-shape of Unaweep Canyon to the beautiful <span class="ss">U</span>-shape
of the present canyon, which is shown in <a href="#fig36">figure 36</a>. The abandonment
of Unaweep Canyon discussed earlier removed the
gigantic storm sewer that for millions of years carried off the
products of vigorous erosion of the canyon walls by the processes
just described. Rock materials that now fall from the
cliffs of the inner gorge in hard Proterozoic rocks and that fall
from the overlying softer sedimentary rocks simply pile up at
the foot of the cliffs to form a canyon equally as <span class="ss">U</span>-shaped as
those cut by glaciers in the high mountains. Indeed, Unaweep
Canyon has been mistaken for a glacial canyon by many, including
some geologists.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p047a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="210" />
</div>
<p>This ends the brief
geologic story of Colorado
National Monument, except
for a peek into the future, a
description of trips through and
around the Monument, and a comparison
with other Parks and Monuments on the Plateau. The temporary
nature of lakes, rivers, and even mountains has been
discussed&mdash;the Monument of today and the new course of the
Colorado River are no exceptions.</p>
<p>The Colorado River did not solve its problems by abandoning
its hard-rock course in Unaweep Canyon in favor of a soft-rock
course through Ruby and Westwater Canyons&mdash;it just
postponed them. The river has again cut down into its old
nemesis&mdash;the hard Proterozoic rock&mdash;in Ruby Canyon just
within the Colorado border, in Westwater Canyon in Utah, and
the Gunnison River has reached the hard rock at its confluence
with Dominguez Creek, not far above Whitewater, as shown in
<a href="#fig34">figure 34</a><i>D</i>. Thus, once again hard rock is slowing down old
man river, and will slow him down for a long time to come.
Someday, Westwater and Ruby Canyons will be deep gorges
like Unaweep Canyon. Then it is quite possible that another
young tributary may sneak around the Uncompahgre arch
some miles northwest of these canyons and pirate the river
into a new soft-rock course.</p>
<p>By this time, the Monument will have changed appearance
considerably. Some of the canyons will have come together by
eating away the ramparts that separated them&mdash;just as the
two entrances of Monument Canyon have already done. But as
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
the lower canyons thus eliminate themselves, the headwaters
will bite deeper into Pi&ntilde;on Mesa, so perhaps the Monument
will simply creep slowly southwestward. However, renewed
uplift, more volcanos, changes in climate, or other events could
alter the picture.</p>
<p>Still, if the geologic clock ran as fast as the ones we use, the
picture of the Monument we see today would be on the screen
only a small fraction of a split second. But the geologic clock
ticks on, slowly but surely, and, someday, the Holocene Epoch
in which we live will become just another brief chapter in the
long geologic history of the Earth.</p>

<h2 class="pcap" id="c41">How to See the Monument</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p048a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="355" />
</div>
<p>How to see the monument depends in large part on
how long you can stay, but it depends also upon the direction
you are travelling to or through Grand Junction and Fruita,
and on the mode of transportation. Moreover, the Monument
has four entrances&mdash;two main entrances from Fruita (West Entrance)
and Grand Junction (East Entrance), and two subordinate
entrances from the Glade Park area to the southwest.</p>
<p>Though by no means as well known as our large National
Parks, Colorado National Monument is more readily accessible
than many. It is on two transcontinental highways (U.S. 6 and
50), is the western terminus of U.S. 24, and is on nearly completed
Interstate 70, one of the most scenic transcontinental
Interstate Highways. Highway I-70 supersedes many
stretches of U.S. 6, 24, and 50, but the latter are still used in
parts of the Grand Valley and elsewhere. The Monument also
is on the main line of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad,
which still maintains limited passenger service between
Denver and Salt Lake City, but this service may eventually be
terminated. Grand Junction&rsquo;s Walker Field is served by
several airlines, and both Grand Junction and Fruita are
served by busses.</p>
<p>Many people driving through the Grand Valley for the first
time are unaware of the Monument&rsquo;s existence unless they
happen to see it on a roadmap or see road signs pointing
toward it, but unfortunately the signs are unevenly and poorly
distributed. People entering Grand Junction from the east on
U.S. 6 and 24 or from the southeast on U.S. 50 are apt to see
one or more of the signs&mdash;particularly when crossing Grand
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
Avenue on First or Fifth Streets. If they are heading westward
and can devote at least half a day, they may drive to the East
Entrance, follow Rim Rock Drive for 22 miles northwestward
through the Monument, stop at some or most of the scenic
overlooks and the Visitor Center, leave via the West Entrance,
and proceed northwestward on U.S. 6 and 50 or better yet on
I-70. However, as will be described below, longer stops are
much more rewarding. Those driving eastward on I-70 may
see the sign at the Fruita interchange pointing southward
toward the Monument&mdash;and may take the above described
quickie trip in reverse. Those heading northwestward on I-70,
however, may not be aware of the Monument until they see the
sign at the Fruita interchange; then, they may not have or take
time to double back southeastward through the Monument. If
they do drive southeastward through the Monument, however,
they can return to Fruita following a very scenic northwesterly
route through The Redlands on Broadway (Colo. Highway 340)
and South Broadway, or they may take a paved shortcut from
near the East Entrance to South Broadway via South Camp
Road (<a href="#Page_118">p. 118</a>). Drinking water and sanitary restrooms are
available in the headquarters area in the campgrounds and
picnic grounds and Visitor Center, and in the Devils Kitchen
Picnic Area. Food is not available in the Monument, so those
planning to remain all day should bring lunches.</p>
<p>I have conducted many groups through the Monument,
always choosing to travel northwestward from Grand Junction
through The Redlands, just northeast of the Monument,
to the West Entrance, then returning southeastward through
the Monument.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> On most days, taking the trip in these directions
affords good lighting for photographing most of the
scenic features. This and other routes are described in the next
section and are plainly labeled so that the visitor may start
with any trip he or she chooses. Regardless of how long you
stay or which routes you follow, it is advisable to be well supplied
with color film.</p>
<p>Some of the view points and overlooks have displays or signs
to help interpret the scenic features, and more of these aids are
added from time to time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>There are three maps in this report (figs. <a href="#fig3">3</a>, <a href="#fig8">8</a>, <a href="#fig26">26</a>); these maps
will be helpful to anyone touring the Monument. <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>
shows streams, highways and roads, principal trails, named
features, overlooks, and trip-guide locations; <a href="#fig8">figure 8</a> is a
geologic map; and <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a> shows localities where most of the
photographs were taken. In addition, topographic maps of the
Monument and adjacent areas by the U.S. Geological Survey,
scale 1:24,000, are available from several sources and are a considerable
aid to visitors. In addition to cultural and drainage
features, such maps show the exact shape of the land by means
of contour lines, which are level lines that go in and out of
canyons, around ridges, and so forth. A special map of the Colorado
National Monument quadrangle is available also in a
shaded relief edition, which gives a three dimensional effect by
proper shading of canyons and ridges. Both types of maps are
for sale at the Visitor Center, and these and adjacent
quadrangles, such as the Grand Junction, Fruita, Glade Park,
and Island Mesa, are sold at several engineering and stationery
stores in Grand Junction and at the U.S. Geological
Survey&rsquo;s Map Distribution Office, Building 41, Federal
Center, Denver, Colorado, 80225. The latter office and the
Visitor Center also sell copies of my &ldquo;Geologic Map of the
Grand Junction area, Colorado,&rdquo; published in 1963 as
Miscellaneous Investigations Map I-404.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p050.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="414" />
</div>
<h4>STARTING POINT</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">1</span></span></p>
<p>We will begin our trip in the southwestern part of
Grand Junction at the intersection of First Street and Grand
Avenue, (this is also the intersection of U.S. Highways 6 and
50 and Colorado Highway 340), by following a sign on
Highway 340 pointing westward toward the Monument. After
crossing a viaduct over the railroad yards and a bridge across
the Colorado River, we come to a traffic light and a sign pointing
left toward the Monument. The road to the left connects
with Monument Road which leads up No Thoroughfare Canyon
to the East Entrance. However, we will continue westward
toward The Redlands.</p>
<h4>REDLANDS CANAL</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">2</span></span></p>
<p>Just beyond the stoplight we cross a bridge over the
Redlands Power Canal which carries 675 cubic feet per second
(cfs, or ft&sup3;s&#8315;&sup1;)<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>
from the Redlands Diversion Dam on the Gunnison
River about 2&frac12; miles south of Grand Junction. A
quarter of a mile northwest of the bridge, most of the water
falls to a lower powerplant that generates electricity for pumping
the remaining 50 cfs to three lift canals, which are used
mainly for irrigating peach orchards in the eastern part of The
Redlands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h4>SOUTH BROADWAY</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">3</span></span></p>
<p>After Colorado Highway 340 curves right it is known as
Broadway&mdash;a paved road serving much of The Redlands and
connecting with the West Entrance of the Monument. We will
follow Broadway about 3 miles, passing low outcrops and roadcuts
of the Dakota Sandstone, some of which contain coal beds
and some of which are covered by a veneer of gravel laid down
by the river when the channel was higher. Then, at the first
store and filling station we turn southwest on another paved
road known as South Broadway.</p>
<h4>SOUTH CAMP ROAD SIDE TRIP</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">4</span></span></p>
<p>Just around the curve to the right is a <span class="ss">T</span>-intersection from
which paved South Camp Road leads south to a growing
suburban area; and 2&frac12; miles to the southeast it connects with
Monument Road at a point only half a mile north of the East
Entrance of the Monument.</p>
<p>Excellent views of the cliffs of dark Proterozoic rocks, the
overlying cliffs of the Wingate Sandstone, and the Redlands
fault along the northeastern border of the Monument are seen
all along South Broadway, but views from South Camp Road
and several connecting roads to the southwest are especially
good. (See figs. <a href="#fig37">37</a> and <a href="#fig38">38</a>.) As noted earlier, the Redlands fault
has a maximum vertical displacement of 700 or 800 feet, but
dies out in scissors fashion at each end.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p050a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="468" />
<p class="pcap">REDLANDS FAULT, looking west from South Camp Road about one mile south
of South Broadway. Fault here is nearly vertical and normal, and lies between
updragged Wingate Sandstone and dark Proterozoic schist, gneiss, and granite.
All or most of the soft Chinle Formation has been squeezed out along the fault.
Note smooth erosion surface atop hard, dark rocks surmounted by slope of red
Chinle Formation and cliffs of Wingate Sandstone capped by lowermost resistant
beds of Kayenta Formation. (Fig. 37)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h4><i>BRACHIOSAURUS</i> MONUMENT</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">5</span></span></p>
<p>As we continue westward on South Broadway, note on the
right the brightly colored mudstone and siltstone of the
Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation strewn with
large blocks of rusty-looking sandstone from the Burro Canyon
Formation, which caps the high ridge on the right. Just above
the deep cut on the right four-tenths of a mile west of the intersection
with South Camp Road is a bronze plaque set in a
masonry monument, whose lettering is easily readable in
<a href="#fig39">figure 39</a>. Many years after the excavation in 1900 (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>),
Elmer Riggs contacted Al Look, of Grand Junction, in regard
to the casting and erection of this plaque. Al, Elmer, Ed Faber,
and a few other citizens put up the necessary funds and personally
erected the plaque and monument. Somehow or other,
<i>Brachiosaurus</i> was misspelled <i>Brachyosaurus</i>, as shown in
<a href="#fig39">figure 39</a>, but the intentions were good. Later I will call attention
to another similar monument commemorating the finding
by Riggs of another dinosaur skeleton.</p>

<h4>WATCH TURNS</h4>
<p>After a sharp turn to the north and another to the west,
South Broadway reaches the top of a hill just above the Elk&rsquo;s
Club and curves gently to the right past sandstone lenses in
the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. A 610-foot-deep

</div>
<h4>LEFT TURN</h4>
<h4>WATCH FOR BUFFALO</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">6</span></span></p>
<p>Half a mile to the north, South Broadway turns sharply to
the left even though another paved road continues northward.
Three-fourths of a mile to the west, we turn northwestward
parallel to the Monument boundary fence for seven-tenths of a
mile before turning north again. The 7-foot chain-link fence
just to the left of the road is the northeastern boundary of the
Monument and encloses the herd of buffalo. In the late forties
or early fifties a young bull challenged the older leader for
possession of the herd and gored and pounded the old bull so
badly he had to be shot by a ranger. During the furious battle
125 feet of this strong steel fence was utterly demolished. It is
reported that sometimes an old bull simply takes one look at
the young challenger and retreats without a battle, but other
lone or rogue bulls may temporarily or permanently leave the
herd for other reasons. Such outcasts are dangerous and unpredictable.
One bull kept a ranger &ldquo;treed&rdquo; for 4 hours on a
steep rock ledge in the broiling sun before moving on to a patch
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
of grass. Four of these critters delayed by one week my walking
out a stretch of the Redlands fault on their side of the
fence. I decided that a live geologist had advantages over a
dead hero.</p>
<h4>REDLANDS FAULT</h4>
<h4>WINGATE DRIVE SIDE TRIP</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">7</span></span></p>
<p>Throughout most of its 6-mile length the Redlands fault is a
vertical or nearly vertical normal fault, but along and near this
0.7-mile stretch it is a reverse fault that dips from 45&deg; to 60&deg; to
the southwest, as shown in <a href="#fig40">figure 40</a> and in the cross section of
<a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>. Good views of the fault are seen all along the fence,
but especially at points one-tenth and four-tenths of a mile
northwest of the first turn, the second of which is shown in
<a href="#fig40">figure 40</a>. Just after turning north on South Broadway, let us
turn west a few hundred feet on paved Wingate Drive to see
the northwest end of the Redlands fault, which passes through
a col to the left of updragged remnants of the thinned red
Chinle Formation and the Wingate Sandstone, as shown in
<a href="#fig41">figure 41</a>.</p>

<h4>MONUMENT CANYON TRAIL</h4>
<p>About half a mile north of the last turn, South Broadway rejoins
Broadway (Colo. Highway 340) at a stop sign. After we
turn left on Broadway and reach the first curve, we get a nice
view westward into Monument Canyon, as shown in <a href="#fig42">figure 42</a>.
The Park Service hopes to establish a new trailhead at the
bridge one-tenth of a mile west of the curve, from which a new
section of trail will follow the normally dry wash southwestward
to join the old Monument Canyon Trail. After we cross
the creek leaving the canyon, we pass a low hill of the Salt
Wash Member of the Morrison Formation on the left. Just
beyond the hill, the dirt road leading southwest to a farmhouse
formerly was the beginning of the Monument Canyon Trail
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). There is a new temporary trailhead a quarter of a mile
north, but it is hoped that a permanent one can be built at the
bridge about a quarter of a mile to the southeast, as noted
above. Hikers may see buffalo along this trail and should
watch out for outcast bulls.</p>

<h4>DRAINAGE DIVIDE</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">8</span></span></p>
<p>About half a mile north of the farm road we reach the highest
point on Broadway (Colo. 340) at a drainage divide. Inasmuch
as the three Redlands Lift Canals end east of the divide, there
is quite a contrast between the lush irrigated lands east of the
divide and the nearly barren desert to the west, a view of which
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
is shown in <a href="#fig43">figure 43</a>. To the southwest of the divide is an excellent
view of the northeastward-dipping beds on the Lizard
Canyon monocline. On the left about a mile northwest of the
divide we pass the other entrance of Monument Canyon, then
Lizard Canyon, and a switchback on Rim Rock Drive ascending
the ridge between Lizard and Fruita Canyons. The water
well beneath elevated tank on left is 650 feet deep and formerly
flowed at about half a gallon a minute from the Wingate Sandstone.
Household needs are obtained by pumping.</p>

<h4>ROAD INTERSECTION</h4>
<p>At the next intersection, Colorado Highway 340 turns right
and continues about 2&frac12; miles to Fruita; the highway to the
left reaches the West Entrance of the Monument in a quarter
of a mile. Before turning left into the Monument, however,
we will interrupt our description of the trip by making a new
start from Fruita for the benefit of people travelling from this
direction.</p>

<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">9</span></span></p>
<p>From the Fruita interchange on I-70, the overpass
leads north into the town of Fruita, and Colorado
Highway 340 leads south about 2&frac12; miles to the West Entrance
of Colorado National Monument. One mile south we
cross the new bridge over the Colorado River; the old bridge
formerly connecting Fruita with the Monument may be seen
half a mile upstream. Just south of the new bridge we see sandstone
on the left and green shale on the right, both part of the
Burro Canyon Formation. The high hill on the left is made up
of brightly colored siltstones and mudstones of the Brushy
Basin Member of the Morrison Formation capped by the basal
sandstone of the Burro Canyon Formation. On the southeast
side of this hill is another bronze plaque set in a masonry
monument, similar to the one at Riggs Hill (<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>), commemorating
the discovery and removal in 1900 by Elmer S.
Riggs of a skeleton of the immense dinosaur <i>Apatosaurus excelcus</i>
Marsh. (See <a href="#fig23">figure 23</a><i>B</i>). About 1&frac34; miles northwest of
the new bridge is the Fruita Paleontological area discussed on
<a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>.</p>
<p>Just south of the hill, the highway curves gently to the left
across a relatively flat surface of the Morrison Formation. To
the right may be seen good exposures of the Entrada Sandstone,
at the north end of which curbstones were quarried from
thin beds of the white Moab Member for use in some of the
parking areas along Rim Rock Drive. Some of the beds are ripple
marked<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> from wave action along ancient beaches or within
ancient lagoons. Some ripple-marked curbstones from this
quarry may be seen in the parking area at Red Canyon
Overlook, and elsewhere in the Monument.</p>
<p>As we approach the Monument we see that to the left the
rock strata are bent downward toward us along what
geologists call a monocline (see figs. <a href="#fig27">27</a> and <a href="#fig30">30</a>), but to the right
may be seen cliffs of dark Proterozoic rocks surmounted by
slopes of the red Chinle Formation and cliffs of the buff
Wingate Sandstone capped by the lowermost beds of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
resistant Kayenta Formation. The bent and broken rocks
ahead are well shown in <a href="#fig33">figure 33</a>.</p>
<p>About 1&frac12; miles south of the Colorado River we reach the <span class="ss">T</span>-intersection
noted previously&mdash;at the end of the trip from
Grand Junction through The Redlands to the West Entrance
of the Monument&mdash;and we are ready for our trip through the
Monument.</p>
<h3 class="pcap" id="c45">Through the Monument from West to East Entrances</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p054a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="247" />
</div>
<h4>WEST ENTRANCE</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">10</span></span></p>
<p>After turning south
on Rim Rock Drive from the
intersection with Colorado Highway
340 (Broadway), we cross the Monument&rsquo;s
northern boundary and reach the checking
station at the West Entrance, where a small entry fee is
charged during the summer. At the first left turn we are in red
beds of the Chinle Formation, then in sheared and broken beds
of the Wingate Sandstone along the Kodels Canyon fault. At
the easternmost loop of the road we may look southeastward
across Lizard Canyon to the Lizard Canyon monocline (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>),
and if we look down the slope to the east we will see one of John
Otto&rsquo;s well-built trails that formerly ascended the west side of
Lizard Canyon to what is now the campground, long before
Rim Rock Drive was built. Do not try to stop at the curve,
however; play it safe, drive on, and park at Redlands View a
quarter of a mile west.</p>
<h4>REDLANDS VIEW</h4>
<p>By walking about 50 feet north of the turnout, we get an excellent
view to the west of the Kodels Canyon fault, as shown
in <a href="#fig31">figure 31</a>. Just to the north of the fault are the sheared and
broken beds of the Wingate Sandstone along the east end of
this fault.</p>
<h4>NEW EARTHFILL</h4>
<p>Just beyond the turnout the road curves left through a cut in
the Wingate Sandstone and ascends the east side of Fruita
Canyon. About a quarter of a mile from the parking area we
get a good view (<a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a>) to the west of the new earthfill on Rim
Rock Drive between the two tunnels. The original fill was
washed out in a few minutes on August 8, 1968, by a cloudburst
that dumped an estimated 4 inches of rain on the mesa
west of Fruita Canyon. A culvert beneath the road just north
of the north tunnel was wholly unable to cope with the
resulting flood, part of which plunged over the cliff but most of
which roared southward through the tunnel. According to the
only known eyewitnesses&mdash;a couple from Ohio whose car was
stalled in 18 inches of swift water in the lower tunnel&mdash;an estimated
4 feet of water flowing through the north tunnel soon
separated the two tunnels by a gaping chasm and flowed down
where the fill had been but moments earlier. They jockeyed
their car back and forth in the south tunnel and retraced the
route back toward Fruita. Later I viewed the chasm from the
portal of the north tunnel and found it awesome indeed.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The road remained closed for 1&frac12; years until December 20,
1969, much to the annoyance and discomfort of both visitors
and Monument personnel&mdash;particularly the latter. During the
summer, the usual 16-mile daily round trip to the post office in
Fruita via the West Entrance was increased to about 80 miles
by way of the East Entrance. During the school season, wives
of Monument personnel took turns driving a station wagon full
of children on two daily round trips to the schools and post office
in Fruita. Note in <a href="#fig44">figure 44</a>, taken only 6&frac12; years after the
road was reopened, that small gullies already have been cut in
the lower half of the new fill. Another local cloudburst could
remove the new fill, but let us hope this does not happen!</p>
<p>On the next curve to the east the road cuts entirely through
the red Chinle Formation, which here has a measured thickness
of 103 feet.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> From the base of the Chinle to about the
creek crossing the road cuts expose the old Proterozoic metamorphic
rocks, which here have a purple hue.</p>
<h4>BALANCED ROCK</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">11</span></span></p>
<p>At the southernmost loop of the road is a parking area for
viewing Balanced Rock. The photograph for the frontispiece
was taken from the hillside near the foot of the monolith.</p>
<h4>HISTORIC TRAILS VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">12</span></span></p>
<p>After the road turns north, we again cross the entire Chinle
Formation, then penetrate the Wingate Sandstone through the
two tunnels (turn on your lights) shown on all the maps and in
figures <a href="#fig33">33</a> and <a href="#fig44">44</a>. Just beyond the highest tunnel (turn off
your lights) we reach Historic Trails View, with a sign noting
the early expeditions that traversed the area. West from the
parking area, but better yet by walking to the westernmost
curve, may be seen the northern part of the Black Ridge Trail.</p>

<p class="pcap">FRUITA CANYON, looking northeast from point on Rim Rock Drive above head
of canyon. Dark Proterozoic rocks floor the canyon, above which are the slopes
of the red Chinle Formation and the cliffs of Wingate Sandstone capped by the
lower resistant beds of the Kayenta Formation. Beyond the Grand Valley are the
dark Book Cliffs and the more distant, light-colored Roan Cliffs, which are
shown more clearly in <a href="#fig48">figure 48</a>. (Fig. 45)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h4>FRUITA CANYON VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">13</span></span></p>
<p>This foot trail is part of the old stock trail over which sheep
and cattle once were driven down to the Grand Valley from
Glade Park and Pi&ntilde;on Mesa. The road then winds upward
through a series of switchbacks cut into the Kayenta Formation
to Distant View and then to a parking spot at the relatively
new Fruita Canyon View, which affords a splendid view
of Fruita Canyon. <a href="#fig45">Figure 45</a> was taken from a point about a
tenth of a mile to the east. On the right are housing facilities
for Monument personnel.</p>
<h4>CAMPGROUND AND PICNIC AREA</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">14</span></span></p>
<p>At the top of the hill just beyond the head of Fruita Canyon,
two roads turn left; the first makes several loops through the
modern campground and picnic area then returns to Rim Rock
Drive; the second enters a large parking lot at the Visitor
Center. Let us take the first road, then turn sharp to the left
again just west of the Saddlehorn and explore the camp and
picnic areas, which are on a gently sloping mesa of the Kayenta
Formation dotted with pi&ntilde;on and juniper trees and
bushes of many kinds. The Saddlehorn is an erosional remnant
of the Entrada Sandstone. (See <a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>.) The deluxe campground
has both drive-through and back-in campsites, modern
restrooms, tables, piped water, and grills. Two of the drive-through
sites on the northernmost loop are shown in <a href="#fig46">figure 46</a>.</p>

During the summer, evening slide talks are given by
rangers at a small amphitheater just north of the Saddlehorn
and to the left of the view shown in <a href="#fig47">figure 47</a>.</p>
<h4>WINDOW ROCK</h4>
<p>An interesting quarter-of-a-mile self-guiding Window Rock
Nature Trail leads from the northeast corner of the campground
to Window Rock and loops back past Book Cliffs View,
which contains a table beneath a ramada. Window Rock Trail
connects with the scenic Canyon Rim Trail, which leads southwestward
to the Visitor Center. Views of Window Rock and
Monument Canyon from Canyon Rim Trail are shown in
figures <a href="#fig48">48</a> and <a href="#fig49">49</a>.</p>

Large groups can be accommodated by making advance reservations. Cliff

monocline. (See <a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>.) (Fig. 47)</p>
</div>
<h4>VISITOR CENTER&mdash;MONUMENT HEADQUARTERS</h4>
<p>After we return to Rim Rock Drive, a double left turn brings
us to a large parking lot. We are now at the Visitor Center and
Monument Headquarters, which is well worth a visit. In the
front of the building are modern restrooms and a drinking
fountain. Inside the lobby may be purchased film, slides, post
cards, maps, booklets, and reports. A narrated slide show and
museum help materially in conveying just what the Monument
has to offer. I was pleased at being asked to contribute several
of the geologic exhibits, partly with the aid of former Survey
artist John R. Stacy. From the back door a path leads to a
fenced overlook for viewing an arm of Monument Canyon. The
overlook also is the beginning of Canyon Rim Trail which connects
about half a mile to the northeast with Window Rock
Trail at Book Cliff View.</p>

<h4>GAP IN ROCK RECORD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">15</span></span></p>
<p>Half a mile southwest of the parking lot is one of the narrowest
stretches of Rim Rock Drive at the edge of a Wingate
cliff that actually overhangs. But do not worry, it is well protected
by a rock wall. At the head of the canyon is a large
jumbled landslide of the Morrison Formation that has covered
the cliff of Entrada Sandstone. Along the narrow stretch and
just beyond the landslide are excellent views on the right of the
erosional unconformity between the eroded surface of the
Kayenta Formation and the overlying Slick Rock Member of
the Entrada Sandstone, a view of which is shown in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>
and a discussion of which is given on pages <a href="#Page_35">35</a> to 39.</p>
<h4>PIPE ORGAN</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">16</span></span></p>
<p>From the next parking area to the northeast at Pipe Organ
Overlook we may hike half a mile over Otto&rsquo;s Trail to an
overlook of the Pipe Organ; a view of the Pipe Organ from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
northwest is shown in <a href="#fig49">figure 49</a>. From about the middle of this
trail we may look to the northwest across the canyon to the
Visitor Center and the Saddlehorn (<a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>).</p>
<h4>DEPENDENCE VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">17</span></span></p>
<p>At the next parking area at Independence View we see Independence
Monument (<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>) from quite a different angle
than the photograph shown in <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>. This view clearly
shows it to be a thin erosional remnant of a narrow wall that
once connected mesas to the northeast and southwest and
which separated the two entrances of Monument Canyon.</p>
<h4>GRAND VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">18</span></span></p>
<p>Grand View, six-tenths of a mile farther southeast, affords
excellent views of several features in and near Monument Canyon.
A short improved trail to the northeast leads to a sandstone
ledge from which the infrared photograph for the front
cover was taken. The trail then veers eastward to a fenced cliff-top
viewpoint from which one may look nearly straight down
to a stretch of Monument Canyon Trail. You may see hikers on
the trail or buffalo in the canyon. The photograph for <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>
was taken from a point just north of the north end of the parking
area.</p>
<h4>MONUMENT CANYON VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">19</span></span></p>
<p>Another 1&#8531; miles takes us to the next parking area at
Monument Canyon View, from which one may walk a short
distance to the northeast. The photograph shown in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>
was taken from a point northeast of the parking area.</p>
<p>From the head of Fruita Canyon to Monument Canyon View,
Rim Rock Drive is on a bench of the Kayenta Formation that
separates the two lines of cliffs. We must now leave this bench,
however, because from near Coke Ovens Overlook to beyond
Artists Point the bench ceases to exist, and the Entrada,
Kayenta, and Wingate form virtually a single cliff. Moreover,
we must get up into the Morrison Formation in order to cross
the divide between Monument and Ute Canyons. For these
reasons, in the next three-quarters of a mile south of Monument
Canyon View the road cuts upward through the entire
Entrada Sandstone. Just beyond the first curve are quarries
on the right from which curb and building stones were cut by
the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930&rsquo;s for protecting
overlooks and narrow stretches of road. At the southwest end
of this stretch is another parking area at Coke Ovens Overlook,
which provides good views of the north side of the Coke Ovens.</p>
<h4>COKE OVENS OVERLOOK</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">20</span></span></p>
<p>The next parking area a quarter of a mile to the southwest is
the Monument Canyon Trailhead of the long trail to the mouth
of Monument Canyon and of a short trail to the Coke Ovens.</p>
<h4>ARTISTS POINT</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">21</span></span></p>
<p>Half a mile to the southeast takes us to a large parking area
at Artists Point, which offers a wide variety of scenic views.
The best exposure of the Summerville Formation in the entire
area that I mapped<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> is on the west side of the road, as shown
in <a href="#fig20">figure 20</a>. A short trail leads down to a fenced overlook for
viewing the Coke Ovens to the north (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) and Monument
Canyon to the northeast.</p>

</div>
<h4>HIGHLAND VIEW</h4>
<h4>DIVIDE</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">22</span></span></p>
<p>The Summerville Formation is exposed on the right for
about the next half a mile. In the next three-quarters of a mile
to Highland View the roadcuts are in the sandstone ledges of
the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation. Another
half a mile through massive Salt Wash sandstones takes us to
the second highest point on Rim Rock Drive&mdash;the divide between
Monument and Ute Canyons, altitude 6,593 feet. From
here we may look far to the south across Glade Park to high
Pi&ntilde;on Mesa&mdash;the highest part of the Uncompahgre Plateau
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
northwest of Unaweep Canyon, where the altitude is about
9,500 feet.</p>
<h4>LIBERTY CAP TRAILHEAD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">23</span></span></p>
<p>Halfway down the hill to the south is a parking area on the
left at the head of Liberty Cap Trail, which goes eastward
about 6 miles to Liberty Cap&mdash;a prominent conical point atop
the Wingate cliff just west of the mouth of Ute Canyon, which
appears on the left skyline of <a href="#fig38">figure 38</a>. From there, the trail
descends about 2 miles to a gate in the boundary fence at the
mouth of Ute Canyon. The roads connecting the gate with
South Camp Road (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) were reported (1979) to be closed to
foot travel by private landowners, so hikers reaching this point
must either retrace their steps to the parking area at the head
of the Liberty Cap trail, or return by a primitive trail up main
Ute Canyon, turn right up the west arm of the canyon, and
regain Rim Rock Drive by a short switchback trail noted on
<a href="#Page_109">page 109</a>. However, the Park Service hopes that in the future
some sort of corridor can be established to connect the trailhead
with the nearby roads. Most of the &ldquo;trail&rdquo; up Ute Canyon
is the normally dry channel of the creek, so hikers should
watch out for flash floods. The round trip by Liberty Cap Trail
alone is about 16 miles, and if the return trip is made by Ute
Canyon the total distance is about 13 miles. Accordingly,
hikers should allow a full day and carry food and water.</p>
<h4>GLADE PARK ROAD</h4>
<p>A quarter of a mile west of the Liberty Cap parking area in
the west arm of Ute Canyon is a junction with a gravel road
that leads 5 miles south to the Glade Park General Store and
Post Office, where groceries, beer, gasoline, and fishing and
camping supplies are available. Glade Park connects with
scenic roads leading east, west, and south. Later, we will cover
in more detail a round trip from the intersection in Ute Canyon
to one near Cold Shivers Point, and another round trip from
Glade Park around the head of No Thoroughfare Canyon and
back to Grand Junction via the Little Park Road.</p>
<p>But to continue with the trip through the Monument&mdash;from
the intersection with the gravel road to Glade Park, Rim Rock
Drive turns abruptly to the southeast and follows the west
arm of Ute Canyon for some 3 or 4 miles, past many interesting
points. For the next 1&#8531; miles to the first culvert,
which crosses a large tributary, the roadcuts are in the
Summerville Formation and Entrada Sandstone. The photographs
in figures <a href="#fig16">16</a> and <a href="#fig17">17</a> were taken looking north from the
culvert and from just northwest of the culvert, respectively.</p>
<h4>FLOOD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">24</span></span></p>
<p>One day when my family and I were approaching the culvert
from the west, we heard a roar like an express train. Looking to
the south we saw that a severe thundershower was occurring
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
on the headwaters in Glade Park, so we raced ahead and
parked east of the culvert just in time to see and hear a 4-foot
wall of red water come roaring down the tributary, rolling
boulders along as if they were basketballs. Unfortunately, we
had no time to ready or use a camera, so we simply raced down
the road embankment and through the trees and brush to the
north in time to see the flood plunge eastward over a 350-foot
cliff of the Wingate Sandstone to the canyon below. This illustrates
the need for caution when following or crossing
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; washes in the desert in stormy weather or when there
are storms in the distance.</p>
<h4>UPPER UTE CANYON VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">25</span></span></p>
<p>About two-tenths of a mile northeast of the culvert is Upper
Ute Canyon View, which affords good views of the northeast
cliff face of the west arm of Ute Canyon.</p>
<h4>FALLEN ROCK OVERLOOK</h4>
<h4>UTE CANYON TRAILHEAD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">26</span></span></p>
<p>For the next 7&frac12; miles Rim Rock Drive is once again on a
bench of the Kayenta Formation between cliffs of the Entrada
and Wingate Sandstones. From Upper Ute Canyon View the
road goes southeastward along the canyon rim about three-tenths
of a mile to a parking area. A short trail leads down
from the parking area to fenced Fallen Rock Overlook; the
view shown in <a href="#fig35">figure 35</a> is from this point. As noted in the caption
of <a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>, and on <a href="#Page_108">page 108</a>, the Ute Canyon Trail
zigzags down the slope from the road a quarter of a mile
southeast of the parking area, but there is no parking area at
the trailhead, so it is safer to park at Fallen Rock Overlook and
walk to the trailhead. The connection with this trail and the
Liberty Cap Trail also is discussed on <a href="#Page_108">page 108</a>. On one hike
down this trail we saw two elk, which is a rare sight at such a
low altitude, for they generally stay on or near Pi&ntilde;on Mesa.</p>
<h4>UTE CANYON</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">27</span></span></p>
<p>About a mile to the southeast, just beyond the steep dropoff
on the left, there is room to park, walk a short distance
through the trees to the east, and observe a fine view of main
Ute Canyon, as shown in <a href="#fig52">figure 52</a>. Just beyond on our right
are the cliffs of the mottled salmon-and-white Slick Rock
Member overlain by the all white Moab Member, as shown in
<a href="#fig18">figure 18</a> and described in the accompanying text.</p>
<p>Half a mile southeast, where the road makes a gentle <span class="ss">U</span>-turn
and continues northeastward, we reach the highest point on
Rim Rock Drive at an altitude of about 6,640 feet. Note that
the pi&ntilde;on and juniper are larger, and the bushes are larger and
greener at this altitude, for the average precipitation increases
as we go higher.</p>
<h4>LOWER UTE CANYON VIEW</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">28</span></span></p>
<p>About a mile northeast of the highest point on the road is a
large parking area on the left, from which a short, shaded trail
leads to a fenced overlook called Lower Ute Canyon View,
which faces the northwest arm of Ute Canyon across the main
canyon.</p>

<h4>RED CANYON OVERLOOK</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">29</span></span></p>
<p>About half a mile beyond this parking area, we reach a small
parking area at Red Canyon Overlook, from which the
photograph shown in <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a> was taken. The dark green bush
of Mormon Tea in the right foreground of <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a> is one of the
largest I have seen in the Monument. The reasons for the differences
between the left and right walls of the canyon are
discussed on pages <a href="#Page_79">79</a> and <a href="#Page_80">80</a>. The ripple-marked curbstones of
white sandstone in the parking area were quarried from the
Moab Member of the Entrada Sandstone northwest of Fruita
Canyon, as noted on <a href="#Page_96">page 96</a>.</p>
<h4>DS ROAD</h4>
<h4>COLD SHIVERS POINT</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">30</span></span></p>
<p>Another 2&frac12; miles around the south rim of Red Canyon and
the head of Columbus Canyon takes us to the junction with the
paved county road known as the DS Road, which leads south
and southwest to Glade Park and to the head of No
Thoroughfare Canyon. This important intersection will be included
in trips through Glade Park and around the head of No
Thoroughfare Canyon, so it will be discussed later. Meanwhile,
we will continue our trip eastward from this intersection.
About a third of a mile to the northeast is a large parking area,
with a path leading to a fenced overlook at the rim of Columbus
Canyon for viewing Cold Shivers Point&mdash;perhaps the most
aptly titled feature in the Monument (<a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>). A primitive path
leads from the overlook to the toadstool-shaped platform at
upper right, on which some visitors dare to stand, but not me.
When the old, steep Serpents Trail was the only route for autos
to ascend from the East Entrance, barrels of water were kept
at this parking area to quench the thirst of boiling radiators.</p>
<h4>HEAD OF SERPENTS TRAIL</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">31</span></span></p>
<p>After leaving the parking area, the downgrade on the Kayenta
Formation begins to steepen to the northeast until it
becomes advisable to shift into second gear. In about half a
mile we descend a series of steep switchbacks cut into the
Wingate Sandstone on the steepening Ladder Creek monocline
(figs. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, <a href="#fig29">29</a>), and we reach the present upper end of the old
Serpents Trail (<a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>), which is now an interesting foot trail.
As noted earlier, it is convenient to hike down this steep
2&frac12;-mile trail and to have one member of the party drive ahead
and await the hikers at the parking area in the Devils Kitchen
Picnic Area, near the foot of the trail. One of many rewarding
views seen during the hike is shown in <a href="#fig55">figure 55</a>, another was
seen in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>.</p>

<p class="pcap">LOOKING NORTHEAST FROM OLD SERPENTS TRAIL, before 1950 when the
trail was still used by autos and trucks. One of John Otto&rsquo;s old foot trails joins
the old road at lower middle. Although no thick lenses of sandstone appear in
the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation in <a href="#fig21">figure 21</a>, in this view a lens
about 50 feet thick begins just around the corner near the base of the high bluff
across No Thoroughfare Canyon and is seen extending as far to the left as the
normally dry wash that drains the canyon. When water flows down the wash
after thundershowers (see <a href="#Page_118">p. 118</a>) or from melting snow, the sandstone lens
takes in water (recharge) which moves slowly down the dip of the lens to the
northeast and supplies several artesian wells. In turn, the light band of the
Entrada Sandstone beneath the cottonwood trees at the right middle and the
dark patch of Wingate Sandstone at the extreme lower right are recharged in
like manner, and they supply water to artesian wells to the northeast. As the
older and deeper sandstones on the right take in water at higher altitudes, the
water in them is under greater artesian head when tapped by wells. If you think
you see covered wagons near the middle of the photograph arranged in a circle
for defense against attack by Indians, you are correct&mdash;a Western movie was
about to be filmed. (Fig. 55)</p>

<h4>FOOT OF SERPENTS TRAIL</h4>
<p>Just beyond the lowest switchback shown in <a href="#fig54">figure 54</a>, we
penetrate the Wingate Sandstone through a tunnel, the south
portal of which is shown in <a href="#fig56">figure 56</a>. After we drive through a
deep cut in the Wingate Sandstone just south of the tunnel, we
cross the entire red Chinle Formation, then descend a series of
switchbacks in old Proterozoic rocks. The Chinle Formation is
crossed again near the foot of the hill, where it is about 80 feet
thick,<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> then we recross the Wingate Sandstone and Kayenta
Formation to the parking area in the Devils Kitchen Picnic
Area, near the foot of the old Serpents Trail.</p>
<h4>DEVILS KITCHEN</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">32</span></span></p>
<p>An improved marked trail leads southward from parking
area at the foot of the Serpents Trail, crosses No Thoroughfare
Canyon, and continues as an unimproved trail to the Devils
Kitchen, a view of which is shown in <a href="#fig57">figure 57</a>. The
petroglyphs shown in <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a> are northeast of this parking
area. Those interested in seeing them should inquire at the
ranger station or checking station at the East Entrance.</p>
<h4>EAST ENTRANCE</h4>
<p>Just beyond the parking area, near the foot of the old
Serpents Trail, a road turns left to a larger parking area for the
Devils Kitchen Picnic Area, where covered tables, grills, and
water are available. Just beyond we pass the checking station
and housing facilities for Monument personnel at the East Entrance
of the Monument. During the summer, fees are collected
at this checking station from persons entering the Monument.
A well just east of the housing area obtains water from the Entrada
Sandstone to supply the houses and picnic area.</p>

<h4>SOUTH CAMP ROAD SHORTCUT</h4>
<p>Three fourths of a mile
beyond the checking station, South Camp
Road turns left and joins South Broadway
2&frac12; miles to the northwest. This provides a fine shortcut for
persons desirous of travelling back northwestward through
The Redlands to regain the West Entrance of the Monument.
The intersection of South Camp Road and South Broadway, a
key point on the trip &ldquo;From Grand Junction through The
Redlands to the West Entrance of the Monument,&rdquo; is noted on
<a href="#Page_89">page 89</a>.</p>
<p>But let us continue our 3-mile return trip to Grand Junction,
in order to point out several things of interest along Monument
Road in the lower part of No Thoroughfare Canyon. As
the canyon narrows just beyond the road intersection, we see
on both sides colorful badlands of the Morrison Formation
capped by the rusty looking basal sandstones of the Burro
Canyon Formation. Behind the building on the right just
before the road curves to the left is an artesian well 575 feet
deep that taps both the Entrada Sandstone and a sandstone
lens in the Morrison Formation<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>.</p>
<h4>GAP IN ROCK RECORD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">33</span></span></p>
<p>About 2&frac12; miles below the checking station, we pass on the
left the basal sandstone of the Burro Canyon Formation
resting on the Morrison Formation, as shown in the lower left
of <a href="#fig24">figure 24</a>. Just beyond we may look up the hill to the left and
see the 40-foot basal conglomerate of the Dakota Sandstone
resting unconformably on an old erosion surface atop the
Burro Canyon Formation.</p>
<h4>FLOOD DAMAGE</h4>
<p>Just before we reach the <span class="ss">T</span>-intersection with the eastern segment
of South Broadway we may still see on the right some of
the destruction caused by a devastating flood that roared
down No Thoroughfare and other canyons on September 7,
1978, as a result of what was termed the worst cloudburst to
hit Glade Park, the Monument, and the Grand Valley since
1958. A house on the flood plain just above the bridge was
badly damaged and was filled with 4 feet of mud, and the
Monument Road bridge across No Thoroughfare Canyon
nearest the intersection was washed out, necessitating the
rerouting of traffic to and from the East Entrance of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
Monument. Moral&mdash;never build a house or even pitch a tent in
a dry wash or arroyo in desert regions! Incidentally, indirect
measurements by engineers of the U.S. Geological Survey indicated
a discharge of 9,290 cfs just above the washed out
bridge in No Thoroughfare Canyon, and 2,980 cfs in Red Canyon
beneath the Broadway bridge.</p>
<h4>SOUTH BROADWAY</h4>
<p>Inasmuch as the bridge on Monument Road has long since
been rebuilt, we will cross it, turn right on South Broadway at
the T-intersection, cross the Redlands Power Canal (<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>), and
join Colorado Highway 340 at the traffic light; thus, we complete a round trip
&ldquo;<a href="#c43">From Grand Junction through The Redlands to the West Entrance of the Monument</a>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<a href="#c45">Through the Monument from West to East Entrances</a>,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<a href="#c46">From the East Entrance to Grand Junction</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p065a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="237" />
</div>
<h4>GLADE PARK ROAD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">34</span></span></p>
<p>A very pleasant 11-mile drive through Glade Park may
be made from the intersection where Rim Rock Drive crosses
the northwest arm of Ute Canyon (<a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>) to the intersection
with the same drive on the rim of Columbus Canyon a quarter
of a mile southwest of Cold Shivers Point (<a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>). The name
Glade Park refers not only to the Store and Post Office mentioned
earlier, but also to a nearly flat farming and ranching
area south of the Monument&mdash;an area entirely different from
the Monument or The Redlands. Most of the cultivated part of
Glade Park is underlain by nearly flat lying Entrada Sandstone
which was weathered to a sandy soil, but a few areas are
underlain by the Morrison Formation. This drive should appeal
particularly to people spending from a few days to a week
or more in the campground. For the more adventuresome,
other interesting roads join Glade Park from several directions,
as noted below.</p>
<p>After leaving Rim Rock Drive at Ute Canyon, on a good
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
gravelled road, we traverse attractive, hilly, wooded country
generally southward for about a mile and climb some 300 feet
to a flat area covered mainly by sagebrush and grass. About 3
miles south of the intersection, we see on the left the leached
white outcrops of the Entrada Sandstone shown in <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a>.</p>
<h4>GLADE PARK</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">35</span></span></p>
<p>Another 2 miles takes us to the Glade Park Store and Post
Office at a four-way intersection.</p>
<p>An improved, gravelled road leads westward through pleasant
country some 20 miles to the Utah State line, beyond
which an unimproved road leads either to the Colorado or the
Dolores Rivers. Future planning calls for improving the Utah
stretch of this road and for building a bridge across either the
Colorado or Dolores Rivers to connect with scenic Utah
Highway 128. If and when completed, this would afford a very
scenic shortcut from Moab, Utah, to Grand Junction via the
Little Park Road (to be described).</p>
<p>South from the four-way intersection an improved gravelled
road takes us through wooded country, past lakes and campgrounds,
to the summit of Pi&ntilde;on Mesa, as noted earlier.</p>
<h4>GLADE PARK FAULT</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">36</span></span></p>
<p>Also, from the intersection a paved county road known as
DS (south) Road leads eastward then northeastward through
farming and ranching country 6 miles to the intersection with
Rim Rock Drive near Cold Shivers Point. Three-fourths of a
mile east of the Glade Park Store and Post Office the road
crosses the Glade Park fault (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>) along which the Morrison
and Summerville Formations on the right have dropped down
with respect to the Entrada Sandstone on the left. Here, the
Entrada also has been leached to white.</p>
<h4>LITTLE PARK ROAD</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">37</span></span></p>
<p>At 1&frac12; miles east of the Glade Park Store and Post Office is
the intersection with the improved gravelled Little Park Road,
which will be described later. At 2&frac34; miles beyond this intersection,
the DS Road leaves the Entrada Sandstone and is on a
wooded stretch of the Kayenta Formation the remaining 2
miles to Rim Rock Drive. The last one-tenth of a mile is
crooked and steep, so please slow down before reaching the
stop sign at the intersection. Some years ago the brakes on a
pickup truck failed as the driver approached the stop sign, but
he was lucky enough to jump out at the top of the cliff just
before the truck plunged to the bottom of Columbus Canyon.</p>

<h4>GLADE PARK FAULT</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">38</span></span></p>
<p>From the intersection
1&frac12; miles east of the Glade Park Store
and Post Office, let us turn southeast on the recently
improved and gravelled Little Park Road around the
head of No Thoroughfare Canyon, which was added to the
Monument in 1978 (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). From the intersection it is about 14
miles to Grand Junction by this route. In half a mile we reach
the new boundary of the Monument at a minor drainage
divide, and as we start down a steep hill beyond we may park
on the right and look southeastward across No Thoroughfare
Canyon along the Glade Park fault (<a href="#fig58">fig. 58</a>) which has produced
the fishtail shape of the head of the canyon, as shown in
figures <a href="#fig8">8</a> and <a href="#fig59">59</a>. A different view of the fault and canyon head
is shown by the stereoscopic pair of aerial photographs in
<a href="#fig59">figure 59</a>.</p>
<p>The Little Park Road closely follows the new Monument
boundary around the south end of No Thoroughfare Canyon,
either on the Kayenta Formation or Entrada Sandstone, and
affords good views into the canyon from several places. East of
the southeast arm of the canyon, the road leaves the boundary
and goes northeastward about 4 miles to the end of the improved
part of the road, but the unimproved part is good, and
the lower 5 miles is paved. On my geologic maps<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> of the area, I
called this road by its older name&mdash;the Jacobs Ladder Road.</p>
<h4>LADDER AND ROUGH CANYONS</h4>
<p><span class="mm1"><span class="mm2">39</span></span></p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile from the end of the improved
stretch, one may turn right on two tire tracks, travel about a
quarter of a mile farther, and park near the junction of Rough
and Ladder Canyons, where interesting geology is reachable
by short walks up Ladder Canyon or down Rough Canyon.
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
About a mile up Ladder Canyon is an interesting abandoned
mica mine.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>

<p>In the geologic story of the Monument discussed on
pages <a href="#Page_17">17</a> to 94, the geologic processes and events leading to
the Monument of today were told in the order in which they occurred;
therefore, the details of the geologic history have
already been covered. Having finished this story and the trips
through and around the Monument, let us see how the colorful
canyons, cliffs, and other erosion forms fit into the bigger
scheme of things&mdash;the geologic age and events of the Earth as
a whole, as depicted in <a href="#fig61">figure 61</a>. As shown in <a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>, the rock
strata still preserved in the Monument range in age from Proterozoic
to Cretaceous, or from about 1,500 million to 100
million years old&mdash;a span of about 1,400 million years. This
seems an incredibly long time, until one compares figures <a href="#fig7">7</a>
and <a href="#fig61">61</a>, and notes that the Earth is some 4,500 million years
old, and that the rock pile in the Monument is only about a
third the age of the Earth as a whole.</p>

<p class="pcap">GEOLOGIC TIME SPIRAL, showing the sequence, names, and ages of
the geologic periods and epochs, and the evolution of plant and animal life on
land and in the sea. The primitive animals that evolved in the sea during the
vast Archean and Proterozoic Eons left few traces in the rocks because they had
not developed hard parts, such as shells, but hard-shell or skeletal parts became
abundant during and after the Cambrian Period. This drawing was made when
the Geological Survey and most others used the term Precambrian to embrace
what is now included in the Archean and Proterozoic Eons. The end of the
Archean Eon and beginning of the Proterozoic Eon has been placed at about
2,500 million years ago. Also, because of more recent radiometric dating, the
ages of the boundaries between some of the geologic periods and epochs have
been changed slightly. Of most concern to this report, the boundary between
the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs has been changed from 3 million to 2
million years. Drawn by John R. Stacy originally for inclusion in a report by
Newman (1976). (Fig. 61)</p>

<blockquote class="ss">
<p class="center">The Age of the Earth</p>
<p>The Earth is very old&mdash;4.5 billion years or more according to
recent estimates. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained
in the rocks that form the Earth&rsquo;s crust. The rock layers
themselves&mdash;like pages in a long and complicated history&mdash;record
the surface-shaping events of the past, and buried within them are
traces of life&mdash;the plants and animals that evolved from organic
structures that existed perhaps 3 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Also contained in rocks once molten are radioactive elements
whose isotopes provide Earth scientists with an atomic clock. Within
these rocks, &ldquo;parent&rdquo; isotopes decay at a predictable rate to form
&ldquo;daughter&rdquo; isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent
and daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated.</p>
<p>Thus, the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of
fossils (paleontology), coupled with the ages of certain rocks as measured
by atomic clocks (geochronology), attest to a very old Earth!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>But this is not the whole story. As indicated earlier, younger
Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks more than 1 mile thick that once
covered the area have been carried away by erosion, and, if we
include these, the span is increased by another 50 million years
or so.</p>
<p>If we consider the geologic formations that make up the national
parks (N.P.), national monuments (N.M.) (excluding
small historical or archaeological ones), Monument Valley, San
Rafael Swell, and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, all
in the Colorado Plateau, it becomes apparent that certain formations
or groups of formations play starring roles in some
parks or monuments, some play supporting roles, and in a few
places the entire cast of rocks gets about equal billing. Let us
compare them and see how and where they fit into the
&ldquo;Geologic Time Spiral&rdquo; (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>).</p>
<p>Dinosaur N.M. and Colorado N.M., with exposed rocks ranging
in age from Proterozoic to Cretaceous, cover the greatest
time spans (nearly 2 billion years), but most of the rocks are
missing at Colorado N.M., as noted below. Dinosaur N.M. has
one unit&mdash;the Jurassic Morrison Formation&mdash;in the starring
role, for this unit contains the many dinosaur fossils that give
the monument its name and fame, although there are several
older units in supporting roles. Grand Canyon N.P. is next,
with rocks ranging in age from Proterozoic through Permian
(excluding the Quaternary lava flows), but here is truly a team
effort, for the entire cast gets about equal billing. Canyonlands
N.P. stands third in this category, with rocks ranging from
Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, but we would have to give top billing
to the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone Member of the
Cutler Formation, from which The Needles, The Grabens, and
most of the arches were sculptured. The Triassic Wingate
Sandstone and the Triassic(?) Kayenta Formation get second
billing for their roles in forming and preserving Island in the
Sky and other high mesas. Now let us consider other areas
with only one or few players in the cast, beginning at the bottom
of the time spiral. Black Canyon of the Gunnison N.M.,
cut entirely in rocks of early Proterozoic age with only a veneer
of much younger rocks, obviously has but one star in its cast.
Colorado N.M. contains rocks ranging from Proterozoic to
Cretaceous (equal to Dinosaur in this respect), but Colorado is
unique in that all rocks of the long Paleozoic Era and some
others are missing from the cast. Of those that remain, the
Triassic Wingate and the Triassic(?) Kayenta are the stars,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
with strong support from the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone and
from the Proterozoic rocks, which floor the <span class="ss">U</span>-shaped canyons.</p>
<p>All the bridges in Natural Bridges N.M. were carved from
the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation,
also one of the stars in Canyonlands N.P. In Canyon
de Chelly (pronounced dee shay) N.M. and Monument Valley
(neither a national park nor a national monument, as it is
owned and administered by the Navajo Tribe), the De Chelly
Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation&mdash;a Permian
member younger than the Cedar Mesa&mdash;plays the starring
role.</p>
<p>Wupatki N.M. near Flagstaff, Ariz., stars the Triassic
Moenkopi Formation. Petrified Forest N.P. (which now includes
part of the Painted Desert) has but one star&mdash;the
Triassic Chinle Formation, in which are found many petrified
logs and stumps of ancient trees. The Triassic-Jurassic Glen
Canyon Group, which includes the Triassic Wingate Sandstone,
the Triassic(?) Kayenta Formation, and the
Triassic(?)-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, receives top billing in
recently enlarged Capitol Reef N.P., but the Triassic Moenkopi
and Chinle Formations enjoy supporting roles.</p>
<p>The Triassic(?)-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, which has a supporting
role in Arches N.P., is the undisputed star of Zion
N.P., Rainbow Bridge N.M., and Glen Canyon National Recreation
Area. The Navajo also forms the impressive reef at the
east edge of the beautiful San Rafael Swell, a dome, or closed
anticline, now crossed by Highway I-70 between Green River
and Fremont Junction, Utah.</p>
<p>As we journey upward in the time spiral (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>), we come to
the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone, which stars in Arches N.P.,
with help from the underlying Navajo Sandstone, and a supporting
cast of both older and younger rocks. The Entrada also
forms the grotesque erosion forms called &ldquo;hoodoos and
goblins&rdquo; in Goblin Valley State Park, north of Hanksville,
Utah.</p>
<p>Moving ever upward in the spiral, we come to the Cretaceous&mdash;the
age of the starring Mesaverde Group, in which the
caves of Mesaverde N.P. were formed, and which now house
beautifully preserved ruins once occupied by the Anasazi (the
ancient people who once dwelt in many parts of the Plateau).</p>
<p>This brings us up to the Tertiary Period, during the early
part of which the pink limestones and shales of the Paleocene
and Eocene Wasatch Formation were laid down in inland
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
basins. Beautifully sculptured cliffs, pinnacles, and caves of
the Wasatch star in Bryce Canyon N.P. and in nearby Cedar
Breaks N.M. This concludes our climb up the time spiral, except
for Quaternary volcanos and some older volcanic features
at Sunset Crater N.M., near Flagstaff, Ariz.</p>
<p>Thus, one way or another, many rock units formed during
the last couple of billion years have performed on the stage of
the Colorado Plateau and, hamlike, still lurk in the wings
eagerly awaiting your applause to recall them to the footlights.
Do not let them down&mdash;visit and enjoy the national parks and
monuments of the Plateau, for they probably are the greatest
collection of scenic wonderlands in the world.</p>

</div>
<p>I am grateful to many friends and
colleagues not only for help on the present
report, but also for help on the two preceding
reports which made this one possible. I refer to my
Professional Paper 451,<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> which supplied the detailed geologic
data and to the first popular-style booklet.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> First of all, I must
acknowledge the great help rendered by members of my
family&mdash;my eldest son Bill for serving as my unpaid field
assistant for most of the detailed mapping of the Grand Junction
area, and my two younger sons Terry and Bob for similar
services during the last phases of the fieldwork. I am especially
indebted to my wife Ruth for material assistance in all
the fieldwork, including the road logging and the color
photography for the present report.</p>
<p>I am grateful to several colleagues of the Geological Survey
and National Park Service for help, data, or reviews of all three
reports noted, and to members of my family for reviewing both
popular-style reports.</p>
<p>For reviewing the present report I am especially indebted to
David V. Harris, Emeritus Professor of Geology, Colorado
State University; Harry A. Tourtelot, Geologist, U.S.
Geological Survey, for reviewing both popular-style reports
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
and contributing petrographic studies to the detailed report;
and to my wife, Ruth.</p>
<p>The comments and criticisms of all reviewers were carefully
considered and most were adopted, but in some places I have
preferred to state things in my own way, and have included
topics that seemingly were of more interest to me than to some
of the reviewers. The responsibility for the form and content of
this report thus remains mine.</p>

sandstones also, are darkened or blackened by desert varnish, a natural pigment of iron
and manganese oxides, silica, and clay. (See <a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>.) The varnish is darker on cliff faces
that have been standing longer. The prehistoric inhabitants of the canyon country learned
that effective and enduring designs could be created simply by chiseling through the thin
dark layer to reveal the buff, tan, or pink sandstone beneath. These petroglyphs were
chiseled when the rock face was vertical; afterwards the slab fell to a horizontal position.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
